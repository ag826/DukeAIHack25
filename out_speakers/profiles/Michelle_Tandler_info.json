This funding helps us double down on what we care about most—building for the people who trust us to run payroll every week. \n\nWhat have we been doing these past few years? Well in an industry that moves fast, payroll somehow stayed slow. Trade contractors—who literally build the world around us—were stuck with software that looked like it was from the late 90s.\n\nSo we built Trayd, a payroll and back-office platform that actually works for construction. Not “construction-adjacent,” not “built for everyone.” Just built for them.\n\nSince day one, we’ve been obsessed with solving the real problems contractors deal with: making payroll seamless so they can focus on building, not admin work. They deserve a tool that’s as relentless about getting the details right as they are about running their businesses. That’s exactly what we’ve built at Trayd, thanks to a team I love putting in the work every single day—solving hard problems, moving fast, and making sure we deliver real impact for the contractors who rely on us.\n\nAs a first-time founder, this journey has been equal parts exhilarating and relentless. I’ve learned more in the past few years than maybe in my whole life combined, and I’m incredibly grateful—for our early customers who took a chance on us, for my cofounder Anna who saw this for me far before I saw it for myself, and for my team that shows up every day to turn a vision into something real.\n\nOh and we’re hiring! So if you want to work on building something that solves real problems for real people, call me ☎️ 122 16 Comments Eric Mackay Infrastructure is now an asset class. If your business is rights‑driven and repeatable, investors are paying attention!\n\nMBW just posted that SESAC has raised $889M through a whole‑business securitisation, taking its total debt to around $1.1B. The deal was 3× oversubscribed, which says a lot about how institutional investors now view music service companies.\n\nThis isn’t a catalogue sale; it’s leveraging the entire SESAC ecosystem - from its PRO business to HFA, AudioSalad, Mint, and beyond - to create predictable cash flows for bondholders.\n\nWhy I think this matters:\n\n- Investors now treat music infrastructure as an institutional‑grade asset class\n- SESAC & Blackstone gain cheap capital for growth, but now face pressure for clean, stable cash flows\n- Songwriters and publishers may see benefits if reinvestment accelerates payouts, though cost‑cutting or restructuring could impact service\n\nWhat is likely to happen next?\n\nI would expect there to be laser-sharp focus on operational efficiency, portfolio reshaping, and revenue acceleration. In plain terms: leaner operations, careful attention to underperforming units, and faster cash conversion.  This could mean more layoffs in the industry too...\n\nThis is another sign that rights‑driven infrastructure is no longer just admin; it’s financeable, investable, and highly scrutinised.\n\nI'm thinking of doing a longer breakdown soon about why this is important, looking at where SESAC could make moves to meet investor expectations, and what this trend means for songwriters, publishers, and the future of music finance.  \n\nLet me know if that is something you would find interesting!\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/giCcC2jb\n#MusicIndustry #MusicPublishing #PROs #MusicFinancing 69 14 Comments Brian Boland Stop celebrating private equity's  \"shared ownership\" stories from KKR and Ownership Works. You're falling for the PR.\n\nThe narrative of Wall Street generosity is a masterclass in what we call \"equity-washing\"—the cynical use of employee payouts to sanitize a predatory business model. It's a performance of progress designed to do one thing: maximize profit for the private equity firm. Look no further than the poster child of this playbook: KKR's sale of CHI Overhead Doors. Their best in class example that falls short of real employee ownership. And what we discovered in KKR and Ownerships Works' annual reports indicates that it is truly an outlier.\n\nKKR and its investors walked away with a staggering $1.96 billion in profit, while the 800 employees who drove the company's transformation received a much smaller share of the gains. This deal was likely subsidized by over $160 million in taxpayer-funded tax breaks, which included treating the employee bonus as a massive, last-minute expense to slash the taxable profit from the sale. The final insult? The workers' payout was taxed as ordinary income at a rate of up to 37%, while the PE partners' massive share was taxed at a much lower capital gains rate of around 20%.\n\nThis isn't a revolution in worker empowerment. It’s a tax-advantaged, leveraged buyout where the house—as always—wins.\n\nDon't just take our word for it. See the full breakdown for yourself. It’s time to understand the playbook, question the narrative, and reject the charade. And instead of investing in Equity-Washing funds shift your investments to the incredible companies who are building Real Employee Ownership and building equitable models that don't just serve the private equity fund. We highlight some of these incredible efforts in our blog. \n\nRead our analysis here: https://lnkd.in/gQy2wnCM\n\n#EquityWashing #PrivateEquity #KKR #Finance #CorporateGreed #TaxPolicy #LeveragedBuyout #LBO\n\nMarjorie Kelly Robert Reich Megan Greenwell Roodgally Senatus Corey Rosen Stephen Dubner\n\nThe National Center for Employee Ownership (NCEO) Employee Ownership Expansion Network\n\nTransform Finance Ownership Capital Lab Apis & Heritage Capital Partners Torana Group Common Trust Seed Commons Shared Capital Cooperative Boston Impact Initiative 52 1 Comment Sean Smith I spoke with Christien Louviere of BDE Capital about his journey from a $330mm exit to becoming an independent sponsor.\n\nChristien shared excellent insights for folks looking to partner with business owners, rather than buy sellers out completely.

    "Michelle Tandler, C’08 | Penn Arts & Sciences at Work Michelle Tandler, C’08 Category Manager, Thumbtack San Francisco Intellectual History Major Over the course of my career I have often found myself thinking “I have no idea what I want to do next. I have no long-term plan.” Whether it was during my senior year in college or four years later at Microsoft, I kept wondering, “Where is this leading?” I’m a decade out of school, and I think this is the first time that I can see a vision of what 10 years out looks like. I’m in a role that feels like a true fit. It’s a really neat feeling, but it took me a long time to get here. I’m in a role that feels like a true fit. It’s a really neat feeling, but it took me a long time to get here. I think my senior-year self would have seen what I’m doing now as being consistent with the intellectual passions I developed while at Penn. I studied Intellectual History which focuses quite a bit on how society’s ideas and ideals progress and change over time. My first semester at Penn I took 17th Century Intellectual History with Professor Alan Kors. We started the course by learning about a world in which most people were illiterate, mass famine was the norm, and individuals were put on trial for asserting that the world was not flat. The invention of the printing press changed everything; people had access to knowledge in a way that had never existed before, the pace of scientific discovery sped up exponentially, and the quality of human life changed dramatically within just a few short decades. The world has never been the same since, and I continue to be enthralled with the power that technology can have to change human lives. I think my senior year self would have been inspired to know I would be working on a high tech marketplace that connects individuals with one another to do work and get things done in a way that has never existed before. That is the kind of step change that makes history. — May 10, 2018 • Photo by Loraine Terrell Share this story: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn",

    "10 Reasons to Meet With a VC Associate | by Michelle Tandler | ThinkGrowth.org Sitemap Open in app Sign up Sign in Medium Logo Write Search Sign up Sign in ThinkGrowth.org · Follow publication ThinkGrowth.org is no longer accepting guest post submissions. Read on for posts that were previously published here. Follow publication 10 Reasons to Meet With a VC Associate Michelle Tandler 5 min read · Oct 11, 2016 -- 17 Listen Share Press enter or click to view image in full size A lot of founders these days are being coached to avoid meeting with associates. Articles like these encourage founders to only meet with general partners (GPs), or risk being a part of a “fishing expedition” at their own expense. While I can understand a number of reasons to avoid putting an extra step between yourself and a check writer at a venture capital firm — extra time/work, they could wrongly ding you when the GP would actually love you and your company — there are also quite a number of reasons to go ahead and meet. Even the most junior of junior, cold-emailing, non-check writing associates (or “principals,” “partners,” “investors,” etc.) can add some value. Here are a few reasons to take the meeting: 1. Associates do the diligence. Associates are often the ones analyzing the financial plans, adjusting assumptions, doing reference check calls, and so on. They also often write the investment memos, which are quite important in shaping the views of the GPs who weren’t on the deal team. It is very easy when putting together these materials to focus on either the positive or the negative components of your business and team. If you’ve developed some rapport and a connection with the associate, they are more likely to see (and emphasize in their materials) the more flattering side of things. 2. They are motivated to get a deal done. Venture capitalists are made, not born, and they are made by doing deals. While your average GP may be up to his eyeballs in portfolio company woes, your average associate is chomping at the bit to get a deal done — stat — and brag all over the internet about it. That deal could be yours! 3. They don’t know their ABCs, and that’s a good thing. While a GP has seen a hundred ways for a company to fail, associates are still bright-eyed and hopeful. They haven’t been through the gut-wrenching experiences of firesales or filing for ABC. (Full disclosure — I looked up ABC for the first time a few weeks ago…) 4. They may be all you can have (at least at first). Many firms are structured in a way such that associates are the gatekeepers to the GPs. This isn’t done to be obnoxious, or to enable the GPs to sit around at the country club counting their LP fee dollars. This is because GPs are *really* busy. They’re in long board meetings, on the phone with their portfolio CEOs, and dealing with whatever fire drill is happening in their most troubled company. One day your company may be that troubled company, and you will be extremely thankful that the associates are providing leverage to your board advisor so she can take your call. 5. Because today’s associate could be tomorrow’s GP. The GP who hired me, Dan Scholnick , sourced New Relic to Trinity Ventures as an associate. He championed the deal within Trinity, took a board seat, and a few years later stood next to founder, Lew Cirne, as he rang the NASDAQ bell at their IPO. Press enter or click to view image in full size Granted, this is not the typical scenario, but my point is, you don’t know what will happen. Today’s associate may be a GP at their firm (or another one) in a few years. You may be raising a new round of financing, or even starting a new company altogether, and find yourself appreciative of the relationship you developed early on. 6. They may have something helpful to offer. Associates are meeting with founders and other venture capitalists all day, every day. While you’ve been buried in your latest A/B test, they’ve likely met with a bunch of your competitors, or other founders and up-and-coming operators who could have some valuable support to send your way. Ask the associate for something specific (e.g., an introduction, perspective on your space, help recruiting). If they dig you and your company, they’ll do their best, and maybe even deliver! 7. You might make a new friend. As cheesy as this sounds, it’s true. Some of the founders, and journalists and seed investors, I’ve met through work have become very close friends. One of the first founders I ever brought into Trinity is now dating a former roommate. Another founder I met through work just got *engaged* to one of my friends. The world is big, and many venture capitalists are natural-born connectors . Might not be so bad to have a few of them in your rolodex (or Snapchat friends list ;-) 8. Goodwill is the currency of Silicon Valley. A founder told me recently that he hits the spam button whenever he receives an email from an associate. That is really harsh! Associates are just trying to do their job, and if you blow us off, I promise you, we remember. Also, karma bites. Don’t take my word for it? Sarah Tavel , GP at Greylock Partners can confirm. 9. It’s just a meeting, not a marriage proposal. If you are *really* that heads down, or crunched for time, how about having a quick phone call? If you have nothing to discuss, or the associate is truly unhelpful, you can wrap it up after 15–20 minutes with a promise to get in touch in the future, “when you’re raising.” If said associate is actually so painful to meet with, you likely won’t have to do a second meeting anyway. You either had very bad founder/investor chemistry, or they may be struggling… 10. And, one last bonus reason — you might want to hire them. Lots of associates are working in venture to find their next gig. They’re typically decently intelligent, thoughtful, and hard-working. Might make a great hire for your budding team! So there you have it, a few reasons to go ahead and take that coffee or phone call. Best of luck in your fundraising (or non-fundraising). May your meetings be fruitful, short & sweet!

    "David Sacks-backed Michelle Tandler shutters another business Dyslexic Font Typeface against dyslexia If you’re unfamiliar with Michelle Tandler, consider yourself lucky. The VC-funded mouthpiece has made herself a thorn in the side of many in San Francisco by pushing for a consistent string of recall elections and spewing wild absurdities on Twitter. These include claims that “dogs are getting addicted to meth-laced feces” to push a pro-conservative, pro-VC narrative. For what it’s worth, methamphetamine is almost exclusively eliminated through urination, not defecation. Now, unfortunately, her latest business, Growth Path Labs, has failed. So, what exactly was Growth Path Labs? Apparently, it was “an audio-first learning company that provides audio courses for professional growth.” Sound vague? It was. The company, which launched in March 2022, has released roughly a podcast a month and a handful of articles. It’s unclear how much she raised for this “company.” David Sacks ties Tandler’s last venture, Life School , was funded by David Sacks’ Craft Ventures . The startup “taught people one new skill at a time by deeply researching topics… and summarizing them in two minutes.” Some of the deeply researched topics covered include how to boil water, how to make tea, how to season water, and how to boil vegetables. Tandler brought attention to herself and her company on April 9 when she posted a tweet that seemed to imply that bringing public hangings back to San Francisco would dramatically reduce crime in the city. To defend her argument, the founder pointed out that countries such as Egypt, India, and Japan still allow hangings. Our society seems to have become seriously complacent. 100 years ago in SF people were publicly hung for their crimes. Often by vigilante groups that wanted to send a message. The hangings worked. Crime would plummet after a few of them. Often for many months at a time. — Michelle Tandler (@michelletandler) April 9, 2023 Read more: Blame the Fed: David Sacks and the VC who cried bank-run Wrong place, wrong time, wrong business The two could be unrelated, but the fact that her business shuttered a mere week after she disgustingly suggested that public lynchings were maybe a good thing is funny timing . So, what does the entrepreneur plan on doing next? Well, the genius took to Twitter to ask the platform in a now-completed poll. The options included starting a podcast, launching a media company, or getting a job. While most people voted for Tandler to get a job, the wealthy San Francisco-based Karen seems to have decided everyone actually wants her to start a podcast . She has no idea what the podcast will be about yet. Got a tip?
