[ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] His paternal grandparents were from Jewish immigrant families who moved to London from Poland , Russia, and Romania , and the family surname was originally \" Garfinkel \". [ 9 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] In April 2025, Garfield participated in the British TV show Who Do You Think You Are? [ 19 ] He uncovered his Jewish roots in Kielce , Poland , and also found that a great-great aunt, Ruchla Garfinkiel, married the first cousin of Władysław Szpilman , the subject of the 2002 film The Pianist .

[ 8 ] [ 21 ] He had originally intended to study business, but became interested in acting at the age of 16 when a friend convinced him to take theatre studies at A-level, as they were one pupil short of being able to run the class. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Garfield attended Priory Preparatory School in Banstead and later City of London Freemen's School in Ashtead , before training at the Central School of Speech and Drama , University of London . [ 27 ] [ 21 ] [ 28 ] His first job was at Starbucks , being moved between three separate establishments in Golders Green and Hendon .

[ 23 ] He also joined a small youth theatre workshop group in Epsom and took theatre studies at A-level [ 26 ] before studying for a further three years at a UK conservatoire, the Central School of Speech and Drama. [ 31 ] Upon graduating in 2004, he began working primarily in stage acting. In 2004, he won a Manchester Evening News Theatre Award for Best Newcomer for his performance in Kes at Manchester 's Royal Exchange Theatre (where he also played Romeo the year after), and won the Outstanding Newcomer Award at the 2006 Evening Standard Theatre Awards . [ 11 ] Garfield made his British television debut in 2005 appearing in the Channel 4 teen drama Sugar Rush . [ 11 ] In 2007, he garnered public attention when he appeared in the series three of the BBC 's Doctor Who , in the episodes \" Daleks in Manhattan \" and \" Evolution of the Daleks \". Garfield commented that it was \"an honour\" to be a part of Doctor Who . [ 32 ] In October 2007, he was named one of Variety ' s \"10 Actors to Watch\". [ 33 ] He made his American film debut in November 2007, playing an American university student in the ensemble drama Lions for Lambs , with co-stars Tom Cruise , Meryl Streep , and Robert Redford . [ 33 ] \"I'm just lucky to be there working on the same project as them, although I don't really expect to be recognized later by audiences\", Garfield told Variety in 2007. [ 33 ] In his review for The Boston Globe , Wesley Morris considered Garfield's work \"a willing punching bag for the movie's jabs and low blows\". [ 34 ] In the Channel 4 drama Boy A , released in November 2007, he portrayed a notorious killer trying to find new life after prison. [ 35 ] The role garnered him the 2008 BAFTA Award for Best Actor. [ 36 ] Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle wrote, \"there is no doubt about the intelligence and sensitivity\" of Garfield's portrayal. [ 35 ] Minneapolis Star Tribune 's Christy DeSmith echoed Biancolli's sentiment, citing his \"detailed expressions\" as an example. [ 37 ] Writing in The Seattle Times , John Hartl noted that Garfield demonstrated range in the role, and concluded: \"Garfield always manages to capture his passion\". [ 38 ] Joe Morgenstern , the critic for The Wall Street Journal , dubbed Garfield's performance \"phenomenal\", assessing that he \"makes room for the many and various pieces of Jack's personality\". [ 39 ] In 2008, he had a minor role in the film The Other Boleyn Girl , and was named one of the Shooting Stars at the Berlin International Film Festival . [ 33 ] [ 40 ] In 2009, Garfield held supporting roles in the Terry Gilliam film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus and the Red Riding television trilogy. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought that Garfield gave a stand out performance in the latter. [ 42 ] With Justin Timberlake at an event for The Social Network in 2010 In 2010, Garfield co-starred opposite Carey Mulligan and Keira Knightley in Mark Romanek 's dystopian science-fiction drama Never Let Me Go , an adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro 's 2005 novel of the same name . He said of his character, Tommy D., \"There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him.\" [ 43 ] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. [ 43 ] He said the experience of being a part of Never Let Me Go was \"just a dream to come true\". [ 44 ] He further remarked that the scenes in which his character—unable to contain his frustration—erupts with a wail, were \"intense\" for him. \"I think those screams are inside all of us, I just got a chance to let mine out\". [ 45 ] For his portrayal of a well-meaning, but dim young man caught in a love triangle, he won the 2010 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor . [ 46 ] Writing for Entertainment Weekly , Owen Gleiberman praised the performances of the lead cast, reflecting that \"these three all act with a spooky, haunted innocence that gets under your skin.\" [ 47 ] In comparison to Mulligan and Knightley, Scott Bowles, writing for USA Today , deemed Garfield \"the real find\" of Never Let Me Go . [ 48 ] The same year, Garfield co-starred opposite Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network , a drama based on the founders of Facebook. On his character, Garfield remarked, \"No one knows who Eduardo Saverin is, and I don't either. Of course, the fact he's a real-life human being, breathing on this Earth somewhere, creates a whole new dimension to my approach because you feel a greater sense of responsibility\". [ 49 ] Initially, the film's director, David Fincher , had met Garfield under the auspices of him playing Mark Zuckerberg , having been referred to him by Mark Romanek. [ 49 ] However, Fincher did not like Garfield for the part as he found Garfield's \"incredible emotional access to his kind of core humanity\" better tailored for the role of Saverin. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] Garfield's performance was very well received; he earned wider recognition and numerous nominations, including BAFTA nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Rising Star , as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance in a Supporting Role . [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Mark Kermode of the BBC expressed his surprise that Garfield had been overlooked for an Academy Award nomination, opining that \"everyone knows he's one of the very best things about The Social Network .\" [ 53 ] Writing in The Wall Street Journal , Joe Morgenstern thought the role was portrayed with \"great subtlety and rueful charm\". [ 54 ] Rolling Stone said Garfield delivered \"a vulnerability that raises the emotional stakes in a movie\", and proclaimed: \"Keep your eyes on Garfield – he's shatteringly good, the soul of a film that might otherwise be without one.\" [ 55 ] The Amazing Spider-Man and worldwide recognition (2012–2016) Garfield at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con Garfield was cast as Spider-Man/Peter Parker , opposite Emma Stone as his love interest Gwen Stacy , in Marc Webb 's The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), a reboot of the Spider-Man film series . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Garfield saw his casting as a \"massive challenge in many ways\", having to make the character \"authentic\" and \"live and breathe in a new way\". [ 60 ] He described Peter as someone he could relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was a child. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] For the role, he studied movements of athletes and spiders, and tried to incorporate them, [ 65 ] [ 66 ] and practiced yoga and pilates . [ 67 ] The Amazing Spider-Man earned a worldwide total of $752,216,557, [ 68 ] and Garfield's performance was generally well received. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] The Guardian 's Peter Bradshaw labelled his portrayal as the \"definitive Spider-Man\" and Tom Charity of CNN commended his \"combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor\". [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] In March 2012, Garfield made his Broadway theatre debut as Biff Loman in the revival of Death of a Salesman . [ 74 ] [ 75 ] According to The New York Times 's David Rooney, Garfield had successfully \"exposed the raw ache of Biff's solitude\". [ 76 ] Garfield was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance. [ 76 ] Two years later, Garfield hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live and appeared in a music video for the song \" We Exist \" by Arcade Fire , playing a trans woman. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Also in 2014, he co-produced and starred in the 2014 independent drama 99 Homes and reprised the titular role in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 . [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Following a deal between Sony and Marvel Studios to integrate the Spider-Man character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe , sequels to the latter film were scrapped, and the role was taken on by Tom Holland in a reboot. [ 84 ] Arachnologists Yuri M. Marusik and Alireza Zamani honored Garfield's portrayal of the role by naming a new species of crevice weaver spider, Pritha garfieldi , after him. [ 85 ] [ 86 ] Following a year-long absence from the screen, Garfield had starring roles in two films of 2016, Martin Scorsese 's drama Silence and Mel Gibson 's war film Hacksaw Ridge . In the former, based on Shūsaku Endō 's 1966 novel of the same name , Garfield played Sebastião Rodrigues, a Portuguese Jesuit priest in the seventeenth century who travels to Japan to spread his faith. [ 87 ] Garfield spent a year with James Martin studying to be a Jesuit priest and went on a silent retreat in Wales. The film's arduous principal photography took place in Taiwan, and Garfield lost 40 pounds (18 kg) to achieve his character's physicality. [ 18 ] Kate Taylor of The Globe and Mail disliked the film and wrote that Garfield \"is sweetly resolute and gently anguished as the missionary Rodrigues but any hope that the actor might elucidate the psychology of philosophical certitude or the pain of religious doubt proves vain\". [ 88 ] At the box office, it earned less than half of its $50 million budget. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] Hacksaw Ridge , however, was a commercial success, earning over $175.3 million worldwide. [ 91 ] In it, Garfield portrayed Desmond Doss , a combat medic during World War II, who was the first conscientious objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honor . [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Writing for USA Today , Brian Truitt labelled the film as \"brutally intense and elegantly crafted\"; he believed that the central role allowed Garfield to bring depth to his career and commended him for portraying Doss with both \"simple sweetness\" and \"steadfast mettle\". [ 94 ] He received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for Hacksaw Ridge . [ 95 ] Established career (2017–present) Garfield promoting Breathe in 2017 Garfield played the role of Prior Walter in Tony Kushner 's two-part play Angels in America at the Lyttelton Theatre in the National Theatre , London from April to August 2017, and the performance was broadcast live to cinemas around the world in summer 2017 through the National Theatre Live series. It was directed by Marianne Elliott and co-starred Nathan Lane , James McArdle , Russell Tovey , and Denise Gough . [ 96 ] [ 97 ] Paul T Davis of The British Theatre Guide w",

    "Andrew Garfield played a Jesuit in Silence, but he didn't expect to fall in love with Jesus. - America Magazine Skip to content “Films were really my church,” Andrew Garfield, pictured here with the director Martin Scorsese, said of his childhood, “that is where I felt soothed, that is where I felt most myself” (photo: Paramount Pictures). People make the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius Loyola for a variety of reasons. Preparing to play a featured role in a Martin Scorsese film is not one you hear often, but it’s probably not the worst reason. Men and women often make retreats to find some clarity about who they are or who they’re called to be. I suppose it was so for Andrew Garfield when he asked America ’s James Martin, S.J., to guide him through the Exercises as he prepared to play the lead role in Mr. Scorsese’s new film, “Silence.” Father Martin was hesitant at first. But Garfield was looking for something. Or someone. And that’s not a bad reason at all. In the end, it was enough for Jim. And more than enough for God. *** It was a rainy day in Los Angeles when I had lunch with Garfield to talk about his experience of the Exercises. We met in a small bustling restaurant in Los Feliz, an old L.A. neighborhood that sits below the iconic Griffith Observatory just east of Hollywood. I was early. He was on time. We were both hungry. Garfield seemed weary. It was just past noon when we met, and he was tired. He had been working for weeks, promoting two movies, filming a third and preparing to return to London for an upcoming stage production. He carried a small collection of notebooks and a phone. Add a laptop and cup of coffee and you might have confused him for a grad student. It was New Year’s Eve, and he was having lunch with a spiritually curious Jesuit whom he had never met before. Not exactly the glamorous Hollywood life one would expect. More like an awkward religious blind date. I could appreciate the weariness. Yet even in his fatigue he was exceedingly kind, generous with his time and thoughtful in his conversation. He made sure we were going to eat. He ordered the polenta, and I the blueberry pancakes. He was tired but grateful—grateful for the chance to recall his year-long experience of making the Exercises with Father Martin, grateful to get back into a place of greater depth and consolation than he was in at the moment—a place of Hollywood self-promotion. “This is like the marketplace of ‘riches, honor and pride,’” he said, referencing, unprompted, a key meditation from the Spiritual Exercises. It was a keen insight and a nice touch. He was speaking my language. He made me feel at home. After getting to know one another briefly, we began to talk about how he came to acting as a vocation and what kind of spiritual experience he brought to the Exercises. “Films were really my church,” he said. “As a young kid it was movies and books; it was nothing remarkable really, just that is where I felt soothed, that is where I felt most myself…safest.” Perhaps, as he noted, a childhood love of story is not that remarkable, but then he added something that seemed to me a very Ignatian insight: “In books and movies, I was transported into myself, into the vast inner landscape of myself.” RELATED: Martin Scorsese talks with America about directing ‘Silence. ‘ St. Ignatius Loyola was similarly transported when he began writing the Spiritual Exercises. After a grave failure, wounded while foolishly trying to play the hero during a hopeless battle, with nothing like an endless newsfeed to occupy his time during a long and painful recovery, Ignatius began to read. He soon came to realize that the consolation he was looking for, the healing he needed, was not to be found in the fantasies of chivalrous fiction but rather in the lives of the saints. Moreover, he came to realize that a deeper and more satisfying life was being revealed not only in their saintly example but in the intricacies of his own passions. The wounded reality of his inner life became a place of graced imagination. Ignatius’ conversion began when he became sensitive to the complexity of his own interiority. In my conversation with Garfield, it became abundantly clear that he shares this Ignatian sensitivity. It was also clear that his “vast inner landscape” is, like many of ours, full of wounds and vulnerability. He knows well the longing for love, and at times, it is a torturous longing. “I have been drawn to stories that are attempting to turn suffering into beauty,” he said. “I feel like I’ve been gifted and cursed with a closeness to some grief…the grief of living….” He paused as if gathering strength to say what he really meant, and then the source of the weariness I had sensed earlier was revealed: “…the grief of living in a time and a place where a life of joy and love is f–ing impossible.” He repeated this thought at various moments in the few hours we were together. His life has been taken up by the burdens of love, by the possibility, or impossibility, of real love. *** Andrew Garfield was, for lack of a better word, successful in the Exercises. “There were so many things in the Exercises that changed me and transformed me, that showed me who I was…and where I believe God wants me to be,” he told me. That’s about as good a retreat outcome as one can hope for. And his success should not surprise us. His training as an actor prepared him well for the dynamics of Ignatian prayer, whereby one imagines oneself within a series of biblical scenes in order to attain “interior knowledge” of God and to articulate that knowledge in a life of compassionate action and generous service. What was more surprising, what surprises him still, was falling in love. When I asked what stood out in the Exercises, he fixed his eyes vaguely on a point in the near distance, wandering off into a place of memory. Then, as if the question had brought him back into the experience itself, he smiled widely and said: “What was really easy was falling in love with this person, was falling in love with Jesus Christ. That was the most surprising thing.” He fell silent at the thought of it, clearly moved to emotion. He clutched his chest, just below the sternum, somewhere between his gut and his heart, and what he said next came out through bursts of laughter: “God! That was the most remarkable thing—falling in love, and how easy it was to fall in love with Jesus.” I suddenly came to appreciate the authenticity with which he experiences the joy of love and the sorrow of its frustration, the pain of its absence. “I felt so bad for [Jesus] and angry on his behalf when I finally did meet him, because everyone has given him such a bad name. So many people have given him such a s— f–ing name. And he has been used for so many dark things.” When I say that Garfield was successful in the Exercises, it is exactly this profession of love that proves the point: He falls in love with Jesus. He suffers with and for the beloved. And his compassionate suffering is given over in a vocation that intends to help others into love and out of its absence. “That’s for me the beautiful agony of creating,” he continued, “the beautiful agony of never being able to fully express the possibility of love and the possibility of loving as he teaches, and living as he wants us to live. My compulsion to work is this longing to express that very thing.” *** The experience of falling in love with Jesus was most surprising, perhaps, because Garfield, like many people, came to the Exercises asking for something else. What he brought to the Exercises was not an explicit desire to know Christ but rather a painful and persistent sense of his own “not-enough-ness.” Like Ignatius before him, Garfield was a young person looking for his own place in the world. And, like many of us, beneath this longing he carried a deep fear, a fear that he wasn’t good enough. “The main thing that I wanted to heal, that I brought to Jesus, that I brought to the Exercises, was this feeling of not-enough-ness,” he said. “This feeling of that forever longing for the perfect expression of this thing that is inside each of us. That wound of not-enough-ness. That wound of feeling like what I have to offer is never enough.” Many of us live with a fear of failure, but what we don’t often realize is that it is not the failure that bothers us; it’s the exposure. It’s not hard to fail; we do it all the time. It’s that people will see us failing. It’s that we will be recognized as a failure that really pains us. When all we want is appreciation, being seen is what we long for; if we fear we’re not worthy of it, it’s being seen that terrifies us the most. This tension is something that Andrew Garfield understands very well. RELATED: America’s coverage of ‘Silence. ‘ The moment he remembers as the deepest experience of God’s presence in his life happened just before his first public performance upon finishing drama school. He was to play Ophelia in Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” at the Globe Theater in London. “It’s about two hours before and suddenly, I feel like I’m going to die,” he remembered. “I genuinely feel that if I step on the stage I’m going to burn up from the inside out. I’ve never felt so much terror, like mortal dread, not-enough-ness, self doubt. Terror at being seen. Terror at revealing and offering my heart. Exposing myself, saying, ‘look at me.’” To calm his nerves he walked up and down the South Bank of the Thames. It was an overcast day and his thoughts turned to escape: “I begin thinking of throwing myself into the river. I have nothing to give, I have nothing to offer, I’m a fraud.” He understands it now as a moment of prayer: “I’m asking for something. I’m asking for help.” And then he heard a street performer singing, rather imperfectly, a familiar song, “Vincent,” by Don MacLean. It was the imperfection of the performance that he remembers most. “If that guy had stayed in bed saying ‘I have nothing to offer, my voice isn’t that good, I’m not ready to perform in public, I’m not enough.’ If he had listened to those voices, I wouldn’t have been given what I needed,” he said. “His willingness to be vulnerable really changed my life. I think I understood for the first time how art makes meaning, how art changes people’s lives. It changed my life.” This shared moment of artistic imperfection saved him: “And literally the clouds parted and the sun came out and shone on me and this guy and I was just weeping uncontrollably. And it was like God was grabbing my by the scruff of the neck and saying, ‘You’ve been thinking that if you go on stage you’re going to die. But actually, if you don’t you’re going to die.’” He has lived ever since with this same creative tension—with a deep fear of being seen and an even deeper need of it. If it is being seen in our imperfection that terrifies us, it is being held in our vulnerability that will redeem us. *** Among the most moving parts of the Exercises for Garfield were the contemplations on the so-called “hidden life” of Jesus. “That felt very important,” he recalled. “Where I’m tempted constantly to be producing, to be seen, to be appreciated, etc., I was shown the beauty of living a hidden life, of retreating in order to offer myself in a deeper way to my art, to my life, to the world.” Considering his evident discomfort with the trappings of celebrity, an attraction to a hidden life is not surprising. And yet, these meditations on the childhood of Christ also revealed a desire to enter into the hidden parts of his own life—into his wounds of not-enough-ness, into the desolate places we all carry with us, but don’t often find a way into or out of. Yet perhaps the most critical exercise for Garfield was not about the hidden life, and not about his own woundedness, but rather about something sacred being revealed, about the vulnerability of God. During the meditation on the Nativity, he imagined himself, as Ignatius recommends, a nurse during the birth of Christ: “I felt at home there. I felt like that was where I was meant to be. In service of this woman doing this profound act.” He began to appreciate how the antidote to humiliation might just be humility. “God, I wish I could feel like that all the time, in humble service,” he said. “If I can make storytelling a service, if I can be of service, and be as humble as I possibly can while doing it…” He loses himself again in the memory of the moment. And I don’t blame him. This is no small thing. Actors have been understood as midwives from the beginning of time. The actor, as with all priestly people, stands before the truth and participates in its telling by way of their words and gestures, by enacting our sacred stories of redemption and love. In contemplating the birth of Christ, Garfield came to know something that other midwifing actors and mystics have known for a long time—that it is by our personification of love, by our humble service, that we become the love for which we long. The experience of the Exercises is sacred because it is a place where we come to know the truth of  love, where the personification of love is revealed in Christ. Feeling yourself participate in the labor of birthing into the world the love you long for is a mystical moment for any of us. It is not easy. It is in every sense an exercise and more. But it is without a doubt the greatest gift. Yet this midwifing of love into the world does not excuse us from the pain of labor. It is not the possibility of love that remedies its impossibility, but rather, it is the personification of love that redeems us in the end. It is the labor of love that saves us. It is, in every sense, a work in progress. “I was brought to my knees by these Exercises,” Garfield said, “and yet I sit here before you, struggling with the same s—. The act of making the film was secondary to the act of going through the Exercises, and the act of the film coming out is third to those things…and the depth of experience follows suit. The depth of the experience of the Exercises was enough. And then making the film felt very, very deep, deeper than any other artistic experience I’ve ever had, but it wasn’t as deep as the experience of the Exercises, but it was still by all intents and purposes very damn deep. And now the film is coming out and I’m back in Shallow-ville. And I’m trying to reconcile that.” Staying in love is not easy, just as staying in the graceful space of a retreat or a moving moment of prayer is not easy. The world comes back to us and we to it. But when I asked whether he still trusts the authenticity of his falling in love, he smiled again, made eye-contact and assured me: “Oh my goodness…this, this was enough. If I hadn’t made the film that would’ve been fine. But the one experience that I wouldn’t want to sacrifice, if I had to choose…it would have been going through those Exercises. It brings me so much consolation.  It’s such a humbling thing because it shows me that you can d",

In 2017, he was nominated for Hacksaw Ridge. He lost to Casey Affleck. That same year Ryan Gosling was up for La La Land, Viggo Mortenson was up for Captain Fantastic, and Denzel Washington was up for Fences. So maybe that was a hard year. 2022 he was nominated for Tick Tick Boom and I think he should have won over Will Smith. I think the other movie he should have been nominated for was 2010’s Social Network. Do you think he should have an Oscar by now? Do you think he could win in the future?

    "Episode 1359 - Andrew Garfield — WTF with Marc Maron Podcast Andrew Garfield was terrified of being Spider-Man. As a 27-year-old who was not yet known to the world, he knew his life would immediately change once he became that beloved character. Andrew tells Marc what he did to protect himself at that time, which included going back to his theater roots and heading to Broadway. Andrew also talks about life since his mother's death, why he considers Ryan Gosling to be one of his inspirations, and why he's been on a spiritual journey with recent projects, including his performance in Under the Banner of Heaven.

    "Nice Guy? In ‘After the Hunt,’ Andrew Garfield Turns Villain Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission PRADA Shirt, at prada.com. Photo: Anton Gottlob This interview with Andrew Garfield was originally published on September 2, 2025 as one of The Cut’s fall fashion issue cover stories. We are recirculating it today now that his film, After the Hunt directed by Luca Guadagnino, is now in theaters. The first scene Andrew Garfield shot for his new movie, After the Hunt, is an explosive encounter in which his character, a Yale philosophy professor named Hank Gibson, angrily confronts a student — who has accused him of sexual assault — in front of her teacher and classmates. Directed by Luca Guadagnino, whose films are known as much for their emotional extravagance as their impish button-pushing, After the Hunt is a Me Too psychodrama that dares to grab a few third rails, and the scene features a lot of yelling and door-slamming and students tearfully cowering. Garfield was feeling the weight of taking on such a fraught character. “I was very serious, just pacing around the corridors of that set,” Garfield says. “And Luca’s like, ‘Darling, are you going to be like this all the time?’” The role, which sees Hank touching women creepily and flaunting his disdain for political correctness, cuts against Garfield’s good-guy reputation. In person, his pleasantness comes through in gently insistent waves. He is soft-spoken and attentive and unflaggingly polite. He puts great thought into his responses to your questions, and when he’s finished, he’ll smile a little smile to indicate I’m done talking now. May I have another? Even when he is dressed in Hollywood incognito — tinted glasses under a dark cap — his brown eyes somehow still absorb you in their benevolent depths. He says heartfelt things like, “I want to know people. I want to be intimate with people, and I want people to be intimate with me.” In This Issue The Cut Fall Fashion 2025 See All He usually plays nice guys, too. As Eduardo Saverin in The Social Network, Garfield is a naïf who gets cheated out of hundreds of millions of dollars because he makes the terrible mistake of trusting his best friend. As Spider-Man, he is a boy wonder whose real superpower is how much he cares about other people. In Martin Scorsese’s Silence, he is a Christian martyr with a seemingly limitless capacity for being persecuted. And in We Live in Time, he plays a father who is so supportive of his dying partner, so steadfast, so nice, that even Garfield has a few problems with him. “Well, he’s a bit of a pushover,” Garfield admits. “Where’s the guy’s spine?” We’re speaking at a coffee shop on a dreamy summer day in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, where he’s filming another Guadagnino joint, Artificial, about the paradigm-shifting rise of Open​AI. Garfield will play founder Sam Altman, whose precocious gifts could be used to obliterate humankind as we know it. Between this and his turn in After the Hunt , Garfield has started to dabble in the dark side, and he is both exhilarated and a bit nervous about it. “I was intimidated by the project,” he says of After the Hunt. “I was intimidated by the character, which excited me. And it felt spicy. It felt very provocative as a piece.” ECKHAUS LATTA Shirt, at eckhauslatta.com . ERL Crewneck, at erl.store . THE SOCIETY ARCHIVE Pants and Belt, available upon request . Photo: Anton Gottlob The role is his finest since Saverin in The Social Network , which introduced audiences to the Garfield who has shown up in some form or another in nearly every movie since: lithe and boyish and elfin, an aspiring adult in his black blazers and dress shirts. Unlike some traditional leading men, whose sharp jawlines and cheekbones could slice through steel, Garfield has always been more fuzzy and delicate, a forerunner of the slighter male stars of contemporary Hollywood, with a long neck that makes him seem fragile, as if that pretty head might just fall off. In After the Hunt, he looks sturdier, hungrier, darkly leonine with flowing hair and a mighty beard. He acts differently, too: lordly and assertive, a rake with a Nietzschean contempt for those he perceives to be beneath him. As he says in one scene, explaining why he is so confident of his professional and personal success, “Only the thoroughbreds have a chance of winning.” Though careful not to conflate himself with his character, he says about Hank, “I think his argument is that great things are never done in the center. They are done at the edges. And you only really become worth your salt as a human being when you go down into the depths of your own humus. It’s not ascension; it’s descent.” It’s an interesting remark from someone whose characters have often aspired to the highest of ideals: kindness, loyalty, even saintliness. They’ve also rarely managed to be all that memorable. Hank Gibson feels like the crucial element that has been missing from a repertoire that has largely hit a single nice note. It suggests that perhaps it’s not possible to be a viable leading man without at least a hint of the menace lurking beneath. GAP Shirt, at gap.com . Photo: Anton Gottlob Garfield is not the only actor going against type in After the Hunt, which revolves around an ambiguous, drunken encounter between Hank and Maggie Price, played by Ayo Edebiri. Maggie says Hank violated her, Hank denies it, and caught in between is Alma Olsson, who is both Maggie’s mentor and Hank’s colleague and confidante. Alma is played with regal ferocity by Julia Robert s, who swears like a sailor, drinks like a fish, and stalks her classrooms like Lydia Tár , hurling insults at the coddled students who get under her skin and offend her brilliant mind with their pat ideas about social justice. Edebiri is her principal opponent, both sympathetic and frightening, a victim-cum-terrorist who weaponizes all the narrative devices of racial and sexual oppression to raze her elders’ lives to the ground. The movie is the first time Garfield and Guadagnino have collaborated, but they have been circling each other for a long time. “He asked me to do I Am Love, ” Garfield tells me, referring to Guadagnino’s ravishing 2009 picture showcasing Tilda Swinton as an older woman who discovers her true self in an affair with a younger chef. Garfield was to play her son. “I think he was on a layover with Tilda at Heathrow,” he says. “He asked me to have a meeting with them in this departure lounge. It felt surreal and decadent and very Luca, retrospectively. I wanted to do the film, but I didn’t have the time to learn Italian.” When I ask Guadagnino about the actor’s moody brooding on set, he tells me, “I love intensity, but at the same time, I want to make sure what I do comes across in a light way.” He adds, “I realize we must have brought Andrew to a very thoughtful place, so I dared to say, ‘Hey, Andrew, is there something I can do to relieve your tension?’ It was more about my concern that something was wrong with him.” ACNE STUDIOS Jacket, at acnestudios.com. OFFICINE GÉNÉRALE Shirt, at officinegenerale.com. GAP Shirt, at gap.com. Photo: Anton Gottlob Guadagnino is a slyly provocative filmmaker, but After the Hunt is his first proper foray into the politics of identity after a series of movies that were simultaneously bold in their declarations and limited in their scope. The title of I Am Love is in essence an argument: that who we are lies dormant within us, waiting for a sensual spark to erupt through the strata of class, smash through conventions, and emerge into the light. Call Me by Your Name captures the world-reorienting moment when we admit that we have fallen in love and that this other person, of all people on earth, has come to represent our tastes and predilections and innermost desires — it could have been called I Am You. Love triangles are a common theme: The three tennis players at the center of Challengers might have been different people altogether, the film posits, if their relationships had only been configured differently. After the Hunt reckons with how the external markers of identity define us, often over our protests — how maleness and whiteness, say, can be both a source of privilege and used against a person in the zero-sum battles of the culture wars. Or, as Guadagnino tells me, “I like the idea of power as a key to understand character and using character to understand the power that underlies our way of being.” The locus of these tensions is Alma, who is torn between her sympathy for her fellow woman Maggie, her intellectual affinities with (and sexual attraction to) Hank, and her own towering academic ambition , which itself is considered a defect because of her gender. But for all their bravado, all three characters stagger across the movie blindly, blown about by forces they don’t quite comprehend. In such a bewildering environment, Guadagnino asks, when the sense of self is at odds with how the world perceives that self, who can say who Alma or Hank or Maggie really are? Garfield is clearly aware the movie risks being perceived as anti-woke, one of a number of new entertainments, such as Ari Aster’s Eddington, that are treating very recent history with a revisionist eye. It is as if a growing pocket of auteurist Hollywood, bucking against the industry’s championing of identity politics, is now convinced there was something extreme and embarrassing and even inhuman about that era. One could interpret the character of Hank, a libertine with large appetites and naked desires and a free mind, as a corrective at a time when disillusioned men are seeking solace in the sculpted arms of Joe Rogan and the misogyny of Donald Trump. At the very least, After the Hunt is poised to act as a stand-in for such debates, much in the way that a Sydney Sweeney ad became a vessel for so much cultural angst. THE SOCIETY ARCHIVE Shirt and Pants, available upon request. CARTIER Watch, at cartier.com. JIMMY CHOO Shoes, at jimmychoo.com. Photo: Anton Gottlob Garfield and Guadagnino say they are merely exploring the truth, messy as it may be. “The pervasiveness of consensus, of mainstream thought, is that things can only be said in one way,” Guadagnino says. “I want to say it another way.” As Garfield sees it, “it’s the duty of the artist, and maybe one of the duties of being a human being right now, to find the thing that we point at outside of us and say, ‘Oh, well, that’s not me’ — to find where that does reside in ourselves.” The point of the movie, in other words, is not to claim that men like Hank have been unfairly canceled, even if it entertains that possibility; rather, it is to reflect the ugly impulses and hidden motivations within everyone. Indulging in the seedier aspects of human nature required a lot of trust among the principals. “I saw in Andrew a real rigor about being malleable, a determination to go wherever he needed to go,” Edebiri tells me. “I was quite moved by it, and it gave me the green light to go there, too.” At one point, Edebiri says, Roberts joked that Guadagnino had assembled all of these incredibly charismatic, funny people to “be quite vicious to each other” and “do a lot of deep staring.” In an email, Roberts writes, “There is a lot of darkness to the story that we took on together and then just put away at the end of the day. All of us did that very similarly.” In one particularly difficult scene, Alma and Hank confront each other in Alma’s spare apartment. Garfield here is at his most dangerous and louche, waking from a nap on Alma’s bed like some feral beast who has been in hibernation — pantless, his wiry chest hair peeping out from a shirt whose two halves are barely clasped together by a single button. The subsequent tête-à-tête brings Alma and Hank’s latent feelings to the surface, a push-pull of revulsion and attraction, aggression and submission, that showcases Hank’s wants in all their unbridled vehemence. The scene was done in one take. “It was astonishing, actually,” Roberts says. “Pure Luca.” Guadagnino says nearly the entire movie was done in one take. “Why do you need to do more?” he asks. “I’m still trying to understand why filmmakers I admire do more takes than are needed when they have such great actors. I’m of the Robert Altman school. Very swift.” For Garfield, the abrupt end to the shooting of that scene came as a relief. “It’s a horrible thing,” he says, “even if it’s all make-believe.” BALENCIAGA Shirt, Pants, and Belt, at balenciaga.com. Photo: Anton Gottlob We leave the coffee shop and head toward Golden Gate Park, Garfield musing about the quirks of playing Sam Altman. (“I keep saying ‘like’ a lot. I wonder if that’s because of Sam — he says ‘like’ a lot.”) The Haight’s colorfully bedecked stores and restaurants are surrounded by tourists and the unhoused, like some fantasy neighborhood of gingerbread houses crossed with the fentanyl crisis. Garfield is attracting smiles and surreptitious glances and calls of “Andrew, love your work!” and he handles the attention, which I can attest is pretty overbearing even for a bystander, with grace and aplomb. That has not always been the case. There was a time when he’d hold a piece of paper with a list of charities to his face when the paparazzi were around, a quixotic attempt to remain a normal person and convince Americans there are more important things in life than celebrity. There was a time, too, when he bared his heart to the press. In an interview with this magazine ten years ago, fresh off playing Spider-Man, you can practically see him writhing as the talons of fame sink into him. “I’m still fucked up in my own ways, and insecure, and scared, and don’t really know who I am,” he said back then, an honest admission that earned him tabloid headlines like “Andrew Garfield Snaps in Interview.” He has learned how to take control of his story, declining to divulge any details about his relationship with Monica Barbaro (who also stars in Artificial ). He seems at peace, actually, even if he has a habit of casing his surroundings for overeager fans like a spy watching for an enemy agent on his tail. “I’m happy because it feels that I’m on the edge of something,” he says. “I don’t know what edge I’m on yet, but it’s definitely an edge.” It’s a strange thing to say about a man who is 42 years old, but, like actors before him who have left their boyish personas behind as they transition to more serious work, Garfield seems like he has grown up. His earlier roles frequently involved an innocent awakening to the world’s horrors, whether it was Saverin realizing he has been outplayed by rivals who are more ruthless and cunning, or We Live in Time ’s Tobias understanding that we do in fact all die. It is only in Spider-Man that the process of maturation is treated as ennobling and fun. With his determination to push himself into uncomfortable places, it’s as if Garfield is acknowledging that being a man is a",

    "Andrew Garfield wanted to marry Ocean Vuong after hearing a podcast In Celebrities 4 min read Andrew Garfield wanted to marry poet Ocean Vuong after hearing him on a podcast Just like you, Andrew Garfield listened to someone on a podcast and fell in love By Zofiya Acosta on January 25, 2022 Share Forget the Marvel Cinematic Universe : This is the crossover of the century. Acting golden boy Andrew Garfield had an interview with The Believer recently where he talked in depth over a number of topics dear to him, like grief and poetry. As a stan, I’d like to humbly suggest adding it to the Andrew Garfield canon. It’s a lovely interview where he shares a unique insight into his life, like how he keeps his ego in check by reminding himself that he’s insignificant compared to the moon (“It’s a practice to be constantly remembering the perspective of the moon”) and him processing his mother’s death (“[Sons] have been losing their mothers for thousands and thousands of years, and they will continue to, and you’ve just been initiated into that awareness and into that reality. Some illusion has been lifted. You’re in a realer version of the world now, and it’s painful”). But my favorite part is where he talks about the poet Ocean Vuong, who wrote the semi-autobiographical novel “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous.” Ever the poetry fan, Garfield said that his book was the last thing he read, and also shared an anecdote: “Before I read his book, I listened to his interview with Krista Tippett [from the podcast ‘On Being’ ]. I was listening and I was just sobbing. I said to myself, ‘Whoever this person is—one day I’m going to marry this woman.’ And I had no idea that [Ocean Vuong] was a beautiful man, because he has this very sweet, high-pitched tone of voice, and I thought, ‘That’s my future wife.’” “Before I read his book, I listened to his interview with Krista Tippett [from the podcast ‘On Being’ ]. I was listening and I was just sobbing. I said to myself, ‘Whoever this person is—one day I’m going to marry this woman.’ And I had no idea that [Ocean Vuong] was a beautiful man, because he has this very sweet, high-pitched tone of voice, and I thought, ‘That’s my future wife’” I could see how Garfield got so smitten. Vuong is one of my favorite writers, and his writing is beautiful. Like Garfield, I could tell from listening to the podcast that he has “the tenderest heart, and the most eloquent, poetic soul.” And also like Garfield, I’ve definitely listened to a podcast before and declared that exact same sentiment. It’s a vibe. Stars, they’re just like us. For his part, Vuong shared a snippet of Garfield’s interview on his Instagram Story today, Jan. 25 . He said, “For the record, yes. If [needed], I will happily be Andrew Garfield’s male wife.” I ship it. Now, since I’m nothing if not the biggest chismosa, I’m listing down the parts from the Vuong podcast episode that I think got Garfield to proclaim that he was going to marry him: 1. “The body is the ultimate witness to love. And I learned that right away. We don’t say, ‘I love you.’ If we do, we say it in English as a sort of goodbye.” 2. “I think all religions have this—outside of all of the orthodoxy and the rigor of ceremonies, at the center of it is trying to remind us that we will die, and how do we live a life worthwhile of our breath?” 3. “One has to wonder, what is it about a culture that can only value itself through the lexicon of death? I grew up in New England, and I heard boys talk about pleasure as conquest. ‘I bagged her. She’s in the bag. I owned it. I owned that place. I knocked it out of the park. I went in there, guns blazing. Go knock ’em dead. Drop-dead gorgeous. Slay—I slayed them. I slew them.’ What happens to our imagination, when we can only celebrate ourselves through our very vanishing?” “The body is the ultimate witness to love. And I learned that right away. We don’t say, ‘I love you.’ If we do, we say it in English as a sort of goodbye” 4. “It’s interesting that wisdom often arrives as a warning. I think it’s often something that those in the center, those in power, never know: that before you leave the house, in order to achieve yourself—one sends one’s children to school in order to fulfill their dreams, and in order to do that, you have to be warned that ‘there is a strike against you, by the way, so sink in. Fade away.’” 5. “I think we’ve built shame into vulnerability, and we’ve sealed it off in our culture—‘Not at the table. Not at the dinner table. Don’t say this here. Don’t say that there. Don’t talk about this. This is not cocktail conversation,’ what have you. We police access to ourselves. And the great loss is that we can move through our whole lives, picking up phones and talking to our most beloveds, and yet, still not know who they are. Our ‘how are you’ has failed us. And we have to find something else.” Screencap from the “Mainstream” trailer Follow Preen on Facebook , Instagram , Twitter , TikTok , YouTube , and Viber Total 7 Shares Share 0 Tweet 0 Pin it 7 Share 0 Action Required!
