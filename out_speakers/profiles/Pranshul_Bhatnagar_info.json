Ternary salts (Hitec salt, Hitec XL) are found to be best suited for concentrated solar plants due to their lower melting point and higher efficiency. Two-tank direct energy storage system is found to be more economical due to the inexpensive salts (KCl-MgCl 2 ), while thermoclines are found to be more thermally efficient due to the power cycles involved and the high volumetric heat capacity of the salts involved (LiF-NaF-KF). Heat storage density has been given special focus in this review and methods to increase the same in terms of salt composition changes are discussed in the paper. Methods of concatenating energy storage systems with nuclear power plants are also discussed with different types of nuclear reactors like MHTGR, PAHTR, VHTR, etc. Nanomodifications of molten salts are done to improve heat transfer properties and efficiency of the transfer. The best dopants for such modifications were found to be TiO 2 , SiO 2 , MWCNTs, etc. Future challenges for large scale deployment of molten salts viz., high volume expansion ratio, low thermal conductivity, incongruent melting, corrosion, etc., are listed and discussed. Corrosion of molten salts and its mitigation has been discussed in detail for developing next-generation storage systems and its remedies are also discussed.

Statistics indicate that energy demand more than doubled in the last decade. This also led to a drastic increase in CO 2 emissions (around 35 billion tonnes as on 2021) causing global warming as power generation is still dependent on fossil fuels. 1 Hence the researchers worldover have focused on alternative sources of energy viz., solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, etc., besides developing novel and sustainable technologies for large scale energy storage. Trends in power consumption are encouraging in terms of shifting toward these renewable sources with lower dependency on fossil fuels though we need to depend on latter for few more decades. The energy emitted by the sun on earth is 4.1 × 10 17 J/h, which exceeds the annual global energy consumption (for the year 2001). 2 Hence, solar energy generated through concentrated solar power plants (CSPPs) is a promising solution to today's energy crisis. However, there often arises an un-co-ordinated mismatch between the energy demand and the energy produced as the alternative energy sources suffer from unpredictable fluctuations viz., variable sunshine period, cloud buffer, uneven wind flow, etc. The potential solution to this problem is development of efficient and sustainable energy storage technologies. Nuclear power plants (NPPs) are an interesting alternative to coal, natural gas, diesel, etc., as they are not only carbon-free but also reliable and economically viable. However, their inability to handle unprecedented load fluctuations and appropriate handling of fuel and generators in the nuclear reactors causing reactivity swings are the drawbacks of this technology. For this reason, energy storage is again required to trap that surplus energy generated during the hours of low demand for using it later when the power demand rises. 3 Therefore, a hybrid system consisting of a heat storage unit and a backup system is being explored along with CSPP or NPP as a sustainable solution to the growing electricity demand. 4 Molten salts are being explored as next generation materials for thermal energy storage (TES) owing to their high heat storage capacities, low vapor pressure, non-toxicity, low cost, high thermal stability, flexibility to modifications, and wide range of application. During off-peak hours, the salts can be heated and stored in an insulated container. 5 Thermal energy can then be converted to electric power using different heat engines. The cooled salt can then be sent to the storage tank again for reheating and continuing the cycle. Historically, heat has been stored in hot and cold water tanks to serve domestic and residential needs. Steam accumulators use the steam released from the NPPs as coolants and store the high-pressure steam as a saturated liquid. 6 The tanks made to store pressurized steam can store the same at high temperatures and are hence found in abundance in multiple parts of Europe and North America despite the potential hazards due to the high expansion coefficient of water resulting in leakages 7 and the closeness of the freezing and boiling points of water giving low operational temperature range. 8 Hybrid systems of solar and NPPs are also reported to be used to achieve higher thermal efficiencies in which solar heat is transmitted to nuclear steam to increase its temperature, and the required continuous heat is delivered via molten salts-based TES systems. The specific objectives of this review are to present: Different molten salts with necessary dopants prominently used as TES materials. Potential applications of molten salts in solar and NPPs. Comparative assessment of various TES technologies. Different configurations of solar and NPPs including hybrid versions. Modification protocols to improve the performance of molten salts using nanomaterials. Corrosion due to molten salts and its mitigation methods. Future challenges and concerns associated with molten salts. This review elaborately encompasses all aspects of molten salts and their usage as heat storage and transfer material for use at solar and NPPs. It starts with a comprehensive yet concise comparative analysis of various TES technologies followed by a discussion on energy storage by phase change materials (PCMs). Popular CSPP designs are presented focusing on their thermodynamic efficiencies and comparison factors. To facilitate heat transfer from one plant location to another, an intense review of heat transfer fluids (HTFs) is done. Furthermore, the motivation to use molten salts arises to store the heat carried by those HTFs, which is successively covered by this review. A wide variety of molten salt mixtures (secondary, tertiary, and even quaternary) are compared based on their thermodynamics and rheological properties like heat capacity, thermal conductivity, viscosity, specific gravity, and range of operating temperatures. These properties are found to be enhanced and thereby storage efficiency by nanoparticle doping. A detailed list of molten salts and their dopants are tabulated in the review. Nuclear TES, different nuclear reactors (MSR, LW-SMR, MHTGR, PAHTR, PB-FHR) used, types of fissile materials and energy storage systems they employ are also discussed in detail. A typical NPP can be inclusively modified to concatenate it with an efficient heat storage technique driven by molten salts. This system is presented elaborately as an nuclear hybrid energy storage (NHES) in this review. The heat storage section of this system uses molten salts in two ways—a two-tank direct design and a thermocline design, both of which are studied and compared based on the relevant parameters. Role of nanofluids to increase the heat storing capabilities of molten salts is discussed. The review finally concludes with the most imminent concerns regarding the usage of such technology at power plants and the future directions. The novelty of this article lies in the comprehensive and inclusive comparison of the many technologies available for TES and their working principles and methods of improving their efficiencies. The more novel hybrid techniques of energy storage are also discussed along with the application of molten salts in them. In order to increase heat storage properties of molten salts, several strategies are provided, and special focus is put on the latest methods associated with nano-modification of molten salts with dopants. A collection of dopants with their characteristics are enlisted and discussed in great depth. A very often over-looked topic of discussion is the problem of corrosion of molten salt storage tanks which is given heavy focus in the last few sections of the paper; their effects, severity, and mitigation strategies are discussed in detail. There has not been any review of molten salts as comprehensive and all-inclusive as this one in a long time. 9 , 10 Furthermore, most studies only consider thermal storage for solar energy, while this review presents energy storage for two alternative energy sources, solar and nuclear energy. 11 - 13 2 THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES There are two types of TES solutions for CSPPs: active and passive. The system is called an active type when the fluid that moves between the storage tanks is chosen as the storage medium. The system is called direct-active if the storage media also functions as the HTF. In the “indirect-active” type, dissimilar pairs of storage and heat transfer media are used with an additional requirement of a heat exchanger. When a solid is chosen as the storage medium, the HTF only flows through it to charge and discharge the battery. The term “passive” refers to such a type of system. Figure 1 shows various TES designs used at CSPPs. 14 Depending on short-term and long-term variations in solar energy availability and electricity demand, such CSPP-TES-integrated systems adopt a variety of operating strategies 15 : Buffering : A transient mode occupies over steam generators due to cloud cover or some meteorological activities that cause stoppage of optimum solar energy from reaching the collectors. Some HTFs possess just enough thermal inertia to help a plant in managing and working out through such buffer periods, however at a reduced efficiency, as a result of which shut-down of turbines is an unpreventable order. Extension of the delivery period : Peak solar radiation may not coincide with peak power demand. A considerable fraction of the energy accumulated when the solar energy received at its peak is stored and used at a later period of time during greater electricity demand or tariffs. Improving the annual capacity factor : Annual capacity factor is an important measure that compares plant's net electricity production vs the amount of energy it could have produced at its peak efficiency for the entire duration of time. The absence of a storage system lowers its capacity factor significantly. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Types of thermal energy storage design. TES, thermal energy storage As discussed below, TES systems can be classified as sensible heat storage, latent heat storage, and thermochemical storage. 2.1 Sensible Heat Thermal Storage The energy is stored/released in sensible heat thermal storage (SHTS) systems by raising or lowering the storage medium's temperature. The desired thermodynamic and rheological attributes that the medium must possess are high thermal conductivity and heat capacity besides long-term thermal stability. Solid materials (eg, rocks, metals, concrete, bricks, etc.,) can resist extreme temperatures, without",

High Resolution Image Download MS PowerPoint Slide The development of new pharmacological strategies that evade bacterial resistance has become a compelling worldwide challenge. Graphene oxide (GO) can represent the nanotechnology answer being economical and easy to produce and to degrade and having multitarget specificity against bacteria. Several groups tried to define the interaction between GO sheets and human pathogens. Unfortunately, controversial results from inhibition to bacterial growth enhancement have been reported. The main difference among all experimental evidence relies on the environmental conditions adopted to study the bacteria–GO interaction. Indeed GO, stable in deionized water, undergoes a rapid and salt-specific DLVO-like aggregation that influences antimicrobial effects. Considering this phenomenon, the interaction of bacteria with GO aggregates having different sizes, morphologies, and surface potential can create a complex scenario that explains the contrasting results reported so far. In this article, we demonstrate that by modulating the GO stability in solution, the antibacterial or growth enhancement effect can be controlled on S. aureus and E. coli . GO at low concentration cuts microorganism membranes and at high concentration forms complexes with pathogens and inhibits or enhances bacterial growth in a surface potential-dependent manner. With the framework defined in this study, the clinical application of GO gets closer, and controversial results in literature can be explained.

Antibiotic ineffectiveness represents a global health issue that demands the development of drugs circumventing microbial resistance mechanisms and attacking new bacterial targets. (1) Graphene oxide (GO), a precursor of large-scale graphene synthesis, stable in water, and easy to functionalize with drugs and proteins, attracted attention for its multitargeting killing strategy, simple production, and low cost. (2-5) Three possible antibacterial mechanisms have been observed: (i) GO sheets cutting bacteria membranes, (ii) inducing oxidative stress, and/or (iii) wrapping and isolating bacteria from the external environment and nutrients. (6) However, from the first evidence of the antibacterial efficiency of GO in 2010, (7, 8) many papers were published, but the overall efficacy of GO remained unclear, as described in recent reviews. (6, 9, 10) First, the effective concentration for growth inhibition is unknown, and size, dispersion state, surface functionality, and type of microorganism dramatically change the antimicrobial results. (6, 7, 11-15) Further, a series of studies claimed no effect or even a growth enhancement when GO was added to the bacterial growth medium. (16-22) As an example, considering effects on E. coli , it has been demonstrated that GO is antibacterial at concentrations below 10 μg/mL (11, 23) or only above 100 μg/mL (24, 25) or that GO can enhance E. coli growth if administered at concentrations between 20 and 100 μg/mL. (17) This heterogeneity of results has been often explained by an inconsistent experimental design among different groups: in particular different methods used for GO synthesis leaving variable amounts of contaminants in solution. (6) Though data for the residual substances in the GO material used in different studies are not always available, we can exclude this hypothesis since in a recent work Barbolina and colleagues demonstrated that contaminants do not influence GO activity. (21) In this work, we point out the role of salt-dependent aggregation in the antibacterial efficiency of GO. Differently from antibiotics or macromolecules used for pharmacological applications, GO is a highly dispersible colloid in water but aggregates easily in solutions containing electrolytes. Wu and colleagues found that sodium, calcium, and magnesium ions cause aggregation of GO at a critical concentration of coagulation of 188 mM, 2.6 mM, and 3.9 mM, respectively and that divalent cations bridge functional groups at the edges of GO. (26) These aggregates have macroporosity and shape that can change the pharmacological efficacy of GO. In order to perform antimicrobial tests, bacteria are suspended in water, NaCl, PBS, or in physiologically relevant cations; all these different experimental conditions drastically alter GO stability and might cause the heterogeneity of the results reported in the literature. (27) Even if the colloidal physics and the “plate–plate DLVO interaction” describing the GO sheets aggregation in electrolyte solutions has been studied, (26, 28) the role played by GO stability has not been fully considered in the outcomes of microbiological studies. To assess the role of aggregation and material surface potential in the bacteria–GO interaction, here we test GO against the Gram positive S. aureus and the Gram negative E. coli . We expose these two species to concentrations of GO ranging from 3 to 200 μg/mL, in two different incubation conditions: in solutions without nutrients (ultrapure water, PBS, NaCl, MgCl 2 , and CaCl 2 ) or directly in growth medium (LB broth). We analyze the growth of microorganisms and characterize GO effects on cells with atomic force microscopy and colony forming units assay and show that GO effects on bacterial growth depend on its stability. At concentrations below 6 μg/mL, GO is effective in all solutions examined and acts as a knife that cuts bacterial membranes. At low concentration, GO is indeed stable, and few ions in solution favor collisions between bacteria and GO edges. As GO concentration increases, the GO killing efficacy increases only in water; in other solutions, GO does not impact microbial growth because of aggregates that shield GO edges. However, when GO cluster size becomes much larger than bacterial diameter, GO aggregates wrap bacteria and impede their growth. This occurs above 100 μg/mL in NaCl, CaCl 2 , and MgCl 2 ; at this concentration, high surface energy causes bacteria trapping. In PBS, GO displays a slight variation of surface charge, and bacteria are still adsorbed on GO clusters. In this condition, as demonstrated by CFU counting, bacterial growth is fostered. Further, we demonstrate that also in the presence of nutrients the instability of GO is a crucial parameter influencing its activity. In summary, we demonstrate the way GO effects can be modulated by the surrounding solution, in order to facilitate GO application in clinics and in environmental science. Materials and Methods Click to copy section link Section link copied! Dynamic Light Scattering and Zeta Potential Measurements GO solutions were prepared as reported elsewhere (29) at 2 mg/mL (Graphenea) and sonicated for 30 min with a probe-sonicator at 50 W (VC50 Sonics and Materials UK) to reduce sample polydispersity. Solutions were characterized with dynamic light scattering with Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, Herrenberg, Germany) equipped with a 633 nm He–Ne laser and operating at an angle of 173°. Solvent-resistant microcuvettes (ZEN0040, Malvern, Herrenberg, Germany) have been used for experiments with a sample volume of 40 l. The measurements were performed at a fixed position (4.65 mm) with an automatic attenuator and at a controlled temperature (20 °C) as reported previously. (30) For each sample, five measurements were averaged, the diffusion coefficient D has been retrieved through cumulants analysis from autocorrelation functions. (31) The equivalent hydrodynamic radius (Z- Average size) was obtained by the Stokes–Einstein equation. (31) Data analysis was performed by Malvern Zetasizer software. The zeta potential was calculated from the electrophoretic mobility by means of the Henry correction to Smoluchowski’s equation. Data analysis was performed by Malvern Zetasizer software with Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, Herrenberg, Germany) averaging 5 measurements. (29) Cell Viability Tests E. coli (ATCC strain 25922) and S. aureus (ATCC strain 29213) have been used to perform viability tests. Bacteria were grown in LB medium at 37 °C overnight, and cells were harvested via centrifugation (4000 rpm for 10 min). Cells were washed three times with deionized water to remove residual macromolecules and other growth medium constituents. The pellets were then suspended in ultrapure water, NaCl Solution (0,9%), D-PBS buffer, CaCl 2 (10 mM), and MgCl 2 (10 mM), Luria–Bertani (LB) broth solutions. Hereafter, we will refer to these buffers by using ddH 2 O, NaCl, PBS, CaCl 2 , MgCl 2 , and LB. Bacterial cell suspensions were diluted in the specific buffers or solutions to obtain cell samples having a McFarland turbidity of 0.7 corresponding to 10 7 –10 8 CFU/mL. 180 μL of cells in different buffers was incubated with 20 μL of fresh GO suspensions at room temperature for 4 h without shaking or for 24 h in LB broth. Growth in LB broth has been followed by measuring OD with Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader. The viability was evaluated by the colony counting method. Briefly, a series of 10-fold cell dilutions (100 μL each) were spread onto LB plates and allowed to grow overnight (12 h) at 37 °C. Colonies were counted and compared to those on control plates to calculate changes in the cell growth inhibition. Atomic Force Microscopy Samples were prepared as explained elsewhere. (32) Briefly, 20 μL of samples were deposited on sterile cover glass slides, air-dried, and washed once with ultrapure water (37 °C) to remove salt deposits interfering with the measurements. After sample preparation, measurements were immediately performed in ddH 2 O with a NanoWizard II atomic force microscope (JPK Instruments AG, Berlin, Germany). The images were acquired using silicon cantilevers with high aspect-ratio conical silicon tips (CSC37 Mikro-Masch, Tallinn, Estonia) characterized by an end radius of about 10 nm and a half conical angle of 20°. Cantilevers with a nominal spring constant of about k = 0.4 N/m were accurately calibrated as previously reported. (32) A large scan area (20 × 20 μm) was imaged in order to determine the number of bacteria on aggregates, while for bacteria integrity areas of 20 × 20 μm 2 were imaged. To characterize the surface properties of aggregates, the root mean square (RMS) roughness was calculated as reported before. (32) Results Click to copy section link Section link copied! Effect of Environment Surroundings on GO Stability To test the activity of GO in different environmental conditions, we exposed bacteria to GO in different solutions (ultrapure water, PBS, NaCl, MgCl 2 , and CaCl 2 ). In Figure 1 , the GO characterization by means of DLS and AFM is presented. In Figure 1 A–E images of cuvettes containing GO in different solutions (200 μg/mL) are reported immediately and after 24 h of dilution from the GO stock solution in ddH 2 O. In ultrapure water, GO is well dispersed in a single layered state with an average thickness of 0.8 nm and an average surface area of 0.19 μm 2 measured from AFM images ( Figure 1 A). In the cuvette, the solution appears homogeneous with a light brown color and remains stable after 24 h ( Figure 1 A). GO displays stable hydrodynamic radius in ddH 2 O between 3 and 200 μg/mL measured from DLS ( Figure 1 F and Figure S1 ), and a of −37.8 mV ( Figure 1 G). Figure 1 Figure 1.

High Resolution Image Download MS PowerPoint Slide In solutions containing electrolytes, GO quickly aggregates, as it is visible from photographs of cuvettes: aggregates form immediately after the dilution of GO in PBS, NaCl, CaCl 2 , and MgCl 2 solutions and precipitate with time ( Figure 1 B–E) after 24 h. GO aggregates have different properties with respect to GO sheets, and their surface area, roughness, and zeta potential will influence the effect on bacteria. (6) The size and surface properties of aggregates vary with the kind of ions in solution. Aggregates form in a concentration dependent manner ( Figure S1 ). After 24 h, a stable size of GO has been measur",
