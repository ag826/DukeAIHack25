There has been an increasing demand for cybersecurity expertise in industries like pharmaceuticals and finance, particularly in areas like data privacy, risk management, and incident response. \n\nPlus, salaries are competitive with NYC, and there's a growing number of innovative tech companies setting up shop in cities like Jersey City and Hoboken.\n\nFor cybersecurity professionals, expanding your job search to include New Jersey can open up a whole new world of opportunities. And for companies, tapping into the NJ talent pool can give you a competitive edge in a tight market.\n\n#NewJersey #Cybersecurity #ITInrastructure #Hiring #Recruitment 35 Christopher Okpala I’ve been an Information System Security Officer in the federal space for 5 years, and here’s the truth nobody tells you.\n\nI’ve done everything an ISSO can do.\nI’ve been the junior ISSO.\nI’ve been the senior ISSO.\n\nAnd every time I get asked, “What’s the real difference?”\nHonestly, the only one I’ve noticed is certifications.\n\nThe work is the same:\nPrepare for ATO.\nTest controls.\nCreate POA&Ms.\nReview vulnerabilities.\nTalk to stakeholders.\n\nSo if you’re trying to break into this role or move up, know this:\nAs long as you master those skills, you’ll be fine.\n\nHere’s the part most people overlook. Higher-level ISSO roles aren’t a different job. They’re often the same work with a different title and pay grade.\n\nDon’t hold yourself back from applying to higher roles.\nSometimes the only thing standing between you and that title is the belief you belong there.\n\n#CyberSecurity #ISSO #RMF 78 6 Comments Abdie Mohamed 💡 Something I wish I knew earlier in my career:\n\nCybersecurity practitioners are, at their core, risk professionals.\n\nAs a risk professional, it's essential to understand when to mitigate, transfer, avoid, or accept risk—because securing everything at all costs isn’t a winning strategy.\n\nEarly in my career, I believed that every vulnerability had to be locked down, no matter what. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nIt didn’t take long to realize that businesses weigh multiple types of risk—cost, operational impact, and more—not just security.\n\nContext matters. You are also playing a game of trade-offs (think opportunity cost).\n\nNot every risk is worth mitigating, especially if it has minimal impact.\n\nThe key is to manage security risk in alignment with the company's risk appetite and attack surface. That’s the sweet spot.\n\nThat's why cybersecurity professionals—regardless of their role—must understand how the business operates.\n\nWith that context, they can help the organization make informed, strategic risk decisions. The security pro will also help the business understand the trade-off with each decision.\n\n\"There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs. You try to get the best trade-off you can get, that's all you can hope for.\"\n\n- Thomas Sowell\n\n#RiskManagement #Economics #GRC #CyberRiskManagement #OpportunityCost #Tradeoffs #GRC #Alignment 55 3 Comments Stacey Champagne We need to talk more about balancing cybersecurity careers with fertility treatments.\n\nI just completed…\n\n… 32 time-sensitive injections into my abdomen over the course of 11 days.\n\n… 6 monitoring appointments at 7am 30 minutes away.\n\n… 1 trip to a DC pharmacy because it’s the only one I can get covered medications through with my insurance.\n\n… $2,500 payment in medication and $15,000 payment for the process because IVF is not covered by military health insurance.\n\nWhile also showing up to work each day.\n\nWhile also leading response to cybersecurity incidents each day (and there were several!)\n\nWhile also juggling high emotions in the office due to the government and economic turmoil taking place.\n\nWhile also severely under resourced.\n\nManaging in a high stress environment such as cybersecurity during fertility treatments is incredibly tough and most people won’t admit they’re going through it—for good reason (pregnancy discrimination is very real).\n\nSo it makes sense…\n\n… why families delay or forgo children.\n\n… why women feel their choice is career OR having kids.\n\n… why women leave tech around age 35.\n\n… why there’s so few women in cybersecurity.\n\n… why our mental health is atrocious.\n\nWhen our careers are so incongruent with the realities of our lives. \n\nIVF is a niche example, but collectively there’s a number of us dealing with situations and circumstances (aging parents, children with special needs, personal life-changing health diagnoses) we wouldn’t wish on anyone.\n\nAND YET\n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Especially in an industry that has the ability to be flexible and supportive if would only choose to.\n\nIf only we had better leadership creating culture from the top.\n\n#womenincybersecurity #cybersecurity #ivf 71 9 Comments Kort Evans Ghost Jobs in Cybersecurity – Here’s How to Spot Them\n\nWe talk about the “cyber talent shortage” all the time.\n\nBut here’s the truth no one likes to say out loud:\n\n👉 Many of the jobs listed online aren’t real (about 20%).\n\nThey’re:\n\t•\tHeadcount placeholders\n\t•\tCompliance checkboxes\n\t•\tPR moves to show “we’re growing”\n\t•\tOr worse, market research to see what talent bites\n\nI’ve been in the industry long enough to spot the signs, but many candidates are still burning hours applying to roles that will never get filled.\n\nHere’s how to spot a ghost job:\n\t•\tThe role’s been posted for 60+ days without updates\n\t•\tNo one on the hiring team engages on LinkedIn\n\t•\tVague descriptions, no real details on responsibilities or success metrics\n\t•\tYou apply and hear nothing… ever\n\t•\tYou do hear back, but it feels like a formality or generic rejection\n\nAnd here’s the worst part: some of these listings are recycled quarterly, just to “keep a pipeline warm.”\n\n💡 Companies:\nIf you’re not actively hiring, pull the listing down.

Indian Journal of Ophthalmology - Case Reports 1(4):p 660-661, Oct–Dec 2021. | DOI: 10.4103/ijo.IJO_3757_20 Open Abstract Steroids are known to cause glaucoma in certain predisposed people (steroid responders). We present three cases where patients developed refractory steroid induced glaucoma following the use of skin whitening creams. In India and various developing nations, fairness creams are very popular and are also source of big business.[ 1 ] In our country, fairness creams are considered as cosmetics and are easily available in the market at a very affordable price. There has been a general inclination toward fair skin let it be because of matrimonial advertisements, television, and newspaper commercials. It is a general belief that cosmetics are healthy, but there have been multiple reports about the hazardous effects of the same. There have been many publications across Asia in dermatology group about the misuse of corticosteroid skin creams and skin whitening creams and adverse effects caused by the same.[ 2 , 3 , 4 ] However, in ophthalmology, although there has been mention about steroid use and glaucoma,[ 5 ] awareness about the use of steroid-based skin whitening creams and their implications is poor among the ophthalmologists. We have described three cases with steroid-induced glaucoma due to suspected skin whitening cream use for a prolonged duration. Case Reports Case 1 A 19-year-young girl presented with chief complaints of frontal headache for a few months. The patient was shown locally 2 months ago and was started on three topical and oral antiglaucoma medications (AGM). The baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) was 48- and 40-mm Hg in her right eye (RE) and left eye (LE), respectively. On examination, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the RE was 20/80 and N18 and in the LE was 20/25 and N6. Approval is obtained and the reference number is: Ethics Ref No LEC-BHR-R-05-21-645. The RE had relative afferent pupillary defect grade 2 with open angles in both eyes (BE) on gonioscopy. The IOP with Goldmann applanation tonometry was 14 and 9 mm Hg in the RE and LE, respectively. The cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) was 0.9:1 in BE and Humphrey visual fields (HVF) 24-2 showed advanced field loss. On further discussion, the patient revealed that she was using Pearly white skin whitening cream for 4–5 months for dark circles around her eyes. Differential diagnosis of steroid-induced glaucoma or possible preexisting juvenile open-angle glaucoma was made. The patient was advised to stop the skin cream and oral acetazolamide and was continued on topical AGM. However, over subsequent visits, the IOP was medically uncontrolled in both her eyes (despite adding oral acetazolamide) and hence underwent BE trabeculectomy with Ologen 1 month apart [ Figure 1 ], following which the IOP was well controlled and visual field defects were stable, over 2.5 years. Figure 1: (a and b) Slit-lamp photograph of the right eye and left eye showing a surgical iridectomy and diffuse bleb post trabeculectomy; (c and d) fundus photographs showing advanced glaucomatous disc damage (red free photograph) Case 2 A 21-year-old male presented with chief complaints of pain in BE and eye strain for the past 2 years. The patient was not on any medication. On examination, the BCVA in BE was 20/30 and near vision was N6. In BE, angles were open on gonioscopy and IOP was 42 mm Hg in BE. Fundus showed BE CDR 0.8:1 in BE with very thin rim superiorly and inferiorly. HVF showed advanced field loss in BE. On taking leading questions, the patient revealed that he was using Faiza skin whitening cream since last 2 years. This led us to the diagnosis of steroid-induced glaucoma. The patient was advised to stop the skin cream and was started on topical and oral AGM and IOP was under control with three topical AGM. However, he needs regular monitoring of IOP. Case 3 A 29-year-old male presented with chief complaints of defective vision in BE for 4 years. The patient was started on three AGMs in BE locally a few months earlier, which had baseline IOPs over 50 mm Hg. On examination, the BCVA was 20/20. N6 in the RE and 20/20 p, N6 in the LE. In BE, angles were open and there was trace posterior subcapsular cataract in BE. IOP in the RE was 17 mm Hg and the LE was 18 mm Hg and fundus showed 0.9 CDR with thin rims with advanced field loss in his LE and 0.7 CDR and early superior field loss in his RE. He was using Pearly white (skin whitening) cream for 4 years. The patient was advised to stop using the skin cream and was advised to continue the AGMs. The IOP was under control with AGM for a few months; however, 6 months later he needed trabeculectomy with MMC in his left eye for uncontrolled IOP, following which the IOP was under control. The RE IOP was maintained with topical AGM. Discussion In India, the use of skin whitening products particularly among the younger generation is not uncommon. Several of these skin whitening products contain strong steroids.[ 2 , 4 , 6 ] It is known that steroids if used for a long time in susceptible individuals may lead to glaucoma and irreversible blindness.[ 5 ] In a case series by A. Agarwal et al .,[ 7 ] they have concluded that patients with long-term facial steroid cream use need to be regularly checked for IOP measurements and optic disc assessment. In multiple studies across Asia, there has been mention about unethical and over the counter use of steroids and facial skin creams for skin lightening and bleaching.[ 6 , 7 ] In a study by Agarwal et al .,[ 7 ] they have evaluated steroids in various common skin creams used for skin whitening in India and they concluded that more than 60% of fairness creams used in India contain steroids which can lead to serious side effects. In a study by Chohan et al .[ 2 ] published in Journal of Pakistan Association of Dermatologists, they have evaluated abuse of facial steroid and fairness creams. In this study, the authors mention that several of the bleaching agents and skin whitening agents such as Faiza beauty cream, Golden pearl cream [ Figure 2 ] are contaminated with high levels of mercury[ 8 ] and steroids and the magnitude of problem is more in developing countries including India. Figure 2: Few examples of the fairness creams that are freely available with high levels of steroid It is very important to note that it is the young people who use these skin creams; the IOP may not return to normal after cessation of skin cream and may need surgery to control the IOP. These young patients have to face the future with advanced glaucoma. It should be common public knowledge that steroids are schedule H drugs that should be dispensed only on physician's prescription. However, easy availability, inefficient regulations, and un monitored use may result in serious health issues and glaucoma-related blindness at a young age. Of note, sometimes steroids do come masked in herbal, ayurvedic products as well. Thus, at all levels, the health care providers need to understand that this is not merely a medical problem but a social problem and the irrational use of skin whitening creams or the steroid ointments needs to be addressed by making them available only with doctor's prescription and with a sign of caution explaining about the potential risk of glaucoma and blindness involved with the use of those skin creams. Awareness through education is the key, which can be initiated during routine evaluations in the clinic. Conclusion Creating awareness about the sight threatening side effects of skin whitening creams would go a long way in preventing steroid induced glaucoma and blindness in young people.
