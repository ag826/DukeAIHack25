    "Perplexity AI - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia American artificial intelligence company This article is about the artificial intelligence search engine. For the namesake measure of uncertainty in information theory, see Perplexity . Perplexity AI, Inc. Trade name Perplexity Company type Private Industry Artificial intelligence , search engine Founded 2022 ; 3 years ago ( 2022 ) [ 1 ] Founders Aravind Srinivas, Denis Yarats , Johnny Ho, Andy Konwinski [ 1 ] Headquarters San Francisco, California, U.S. [ 2 ] Area served Worldwide Products Perplexity Perplexity Pro Perplexity Assistant Perplexity Comet [ 3 ] Number of employees 52 (2024) Website perplexity .ai Perplexity AI, Inc. , or simply Perplexity , is an American privately held software company offering a web search engine that processes user queries and synthesizes responses. [ 4 ] Perplexity products use large language models and incorporate real-time web search capabilities, providing responses based on current Internet content, including inline source citations. [ 5 ] A free public version is available, while a paid Pro subscription offers access to more advanced language models and additional features. [ 6 ] Perplexity AI, Inc. was founded in 2022 [ 7 ] by Aravind Srinivas, Denis Yarats , Johnny Ho, and Andy Konwinski . As of September 2025, the company was valued at US$20 billion. [ 8 ] Perplexity AI has attracted legal scrutiny over allegations of copyright infringement , unauthorized content use, and trademark issues from several major media organizations, including the BBC , Dow Jones , and The New York Times . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] According to separate analyses by Wired and later Cloudflare , Perplexity uses undisclosed web crawlers with spoofed user-agent strings to scrape the content of news websites who disallow or explicitly block web scraping. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] History [ edit ] In August 2022, Perplexity AI, Inc. was founded by Aravind Srinivas, Denis Yarats , Johnny Ho, and Andy Konwinski , engineers with backgrounds in back-end systems, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning . [ 13 ] It launched its main search engine on December 7, 2022, and has since released a Google Chrome extension and an app for iOS and Android . [ 6 ] [ 5 ] [ 14 ] In February 2023, Perplexity reported two million unique visitors. [ 5 ] By April 2024, Perplexity had raised $165 million in funding , valuing the company at over $1 billion. [ 15 ] As of June 2025, Perplexity closed a $500 million round of funding that elevated its valuation to $14 billion. [ 16 ] Investors in Perplexity AI have included Jeff Bezos , Tobias Lütke , Nat Friedman , Nvidia , and Databricks . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 15 ] During Bloomberg’s Tech Summit 2025, Srinivas shared that the company processed 780 million queries in May 2025, experiencing more than 20% month-over-month growth, processing around 30 million queries daily. [ 19 ] In July 2024, Perplexity announced the launch of a new publishers' program to share ad revenue with partners. [ 20 ] On January 18, 2025, the day before the impending U.S. ban on the social media app TikTok , Perplexity submitted a proposal for a merger with TikTok US. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] On August 12, 2025, Perplexity made a bid to buy Google Chrome from Google for $34.5 billion. [ 25 ] Perplexity stated that the sale could remedy anti-trust litigation against Google, in which a judge was considering compelling the sale of Chrome. [ 26 ] Products and services [ edit ] Perplexity AI Screenshot of Perplexity AI answer to \"What is Vilnius \" prompt Developers Aravind Srinivas Denis Yarats Johnny Ho Andy Konwinski [ 6 ] Initial release December 7, 2022 ; 2 years ago ( 2022-12-07 ) Engine GPT-5 Claude Gemini Grok o4-mini Sonar Type Search engine Large language model Generative pre-trained transformer [ 6 ] Website perplexity.ai Perplexity's main product is a search engine powered by generative AI, which searches for information online and summarizes it to answer the prompt provided by the user. [ 17 ] Perplexity also enables users to generate customizable web pages and research presentations based on user prompts. [ 27 ] Perplexity incorporates a freemium model for individual users, while a paid enterprise service is also available. [ 15 ] Perplexity Pro [ edit ] Perplexity Pro, the premium subscription tier of Perplexity AI, provides access to an API [ 17 ] and also enables users to search both internal files and web content. It allows the user to select between backend models such as GPT-5 , GPT-4.1 , o4-mini , Claude 4.0 , Grok 4 and Gemini Pro 2.5 . [ 28 ] The company has also developed its own models Sonar (based on Llama 3.3) [ 29 ] and R1 1776 (based on DeepSeek R1). [ 30 ] Internal Knowledge Search [ edit ] Internal Knowledge Search enables Pro and Enterprise Pro users to simultaneously search across web content and internal documents. Users can upload and search through Excel, Word, PDF, and other common file formats. Enterprise Pro users have a limit of 500 files for upload and indexing. [ 31 ] Search API [ edit ] Perplexity's Search API provides AI developers with programmatic access to the company's search infrastructure. The release in September 2025 includes a software development kit, an open-source evaluation framework called search_evals , and documentation detailing the API's design and optimization. [ 32 ] Shopping hub [ edit ] Perplexity's Shopping Hub launched in November 2024 with backing by Amazon and Nvidia . [ 33 ] It is an online shopping platform that includes AI-generated product recommendations and enables users to purchase products directly through Perplexity's interface. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Finance [ edit ] In October 2024, Perplexity AI introduced new finance-related features, including looking up stock prices and company earnings data. The tool provides real-time stock quotes and price tracking, industry peer comparisons and basic financial analysis tools. The platform sources its financial data from Financial Modeling Prep. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Assistant [ edit ] In January 2025, Perplexity launched the Perplexity Assistant, an AI-powered tool designed to enhance the functionality of its search engine. It can perform tasks across multiple apps, such as hailing a ride or searching for a song, and is capable of maintaining context across actions. [ 14 ] The assistant is also multi-modal, meaning it can use a phone's camera to provide answers about the user's surroundings or on-screen content. [ 14 ] Perplexity has acknowledged that the assistant is still in development and may not always function as expected. For instance, certain features, such as summarizing unread emails or upcoming calendar events, require users to enable a workaround based on notifications. [ 14 ] Comet [ edit ] In July 2025, Perplexity launched Comet , an AI browser based on Chromium . Initially, access to the browser was limited to users subscribed to the highest, most expensive subscription tier, with broader availability expected over time. [ 37 ] The browser was later released for free download in October 2025. [ 38 ] A key feature of the browser is the integration of the Perplexity search engine, [ 39 ] which enables users to perform a variety of tasks such as generating article summaries, describing an image, conducting research about a topic and composing emails. [ 40 ] Truth Social chatbot [ edit ] Perplexity has been contracted to produce a chatbot for Donald Trump 's social media platform Truth Social . [ 41 ] Leadership [ edit ] Aravind Srinivas is the CEO and co-founder of Perplexity AI. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] He previously held research positions at OpenAI , Google Brain , and DeepMind focusing on machine learning and artificial intelligence. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Controversies [ edit ] Copyright and trademark infringement allegations [ edit ] In June 2024, Forbes publicly criticized Perplexity for using their content. According to Forbes , Perplexity published a story largely copied from a proprietary Forbes article without mentioning or prominently citing Forbes . In response, Srinivas said that the feature had some \"rough edges\" and accepted feedback but maintained that Perplexity only \"aggregates\" rather than plagiarizes information. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] In October 2024, The New York Times sent a cease-and-desist notice to Perplexity to stop accessing and using NYT content, claiming that Perplexity is violating its copyright by scraping data from its website. [ 49 ] In June 2024, Dow Jones and New York Post filed a lawsuit against Perplexity, alleging copyright infringement. The lawsuit also alleges that Perplexity attributed quotes to an article on F-16 jets for Ukraine that never appeared in the original article. [ 50 ] Perplexity released a blog post to address the lawsuits on October 24, 2024. It stated that the complaints are misleading and reiterated that it was open to revenue-sharing programs. [ 51 ] On January 31, 2025, Perplexity was sued in the United States for alleged trademark infringement by Perplexity Solved Solutions (PSS), a software firm founded in 2017. [ 52 ] The lawsuit claims that Perplexity AI's use of the name \"Perplexity\" violates PSS's federally registered trademark and could cause consumer confusion. PSS had previously declined an offer from Perplexity AI to purchase the trademark in 2023. The suit seeks to prevent Perplexity AI from using the name in its branding and marketing. [ 53 ] In June 2025, the BBC threatened legal action against Perplexity AI, demanding that the company stop the unauthorized scraping of its content, delete all retained BBC material used in training its models, and provide financial compensation for the infringement of its intellectual property rights. [ 54 ] On August 8, 2025, the Japanese newspaper company Yomiuri Shimbun filed a lawsuit against Perplexity for \"free-riding\" of 120,000 articles of the publication from February to June 2025. [ 55 ] Later that month, two more Japanese newspaper companies, The Asahi Shimbun and The Nikkei , also filed lawsuit against the company for alleged copyright infringement. [ 56 ] Reddit lawsuit [ edit ] In October 2025, Reddit sued Perplexity in federal court in New York, alleging that it and three other companies unlawfully scraped its data. [ 57 ] Stealth web crawlers [ edit ] In June 2024, separate investigations by the magazine Wired and web developer Robb Knight found that Perplexity does not respect the Robot Exclusion Protocol (or robots.txt ) standard, which may include requests for web crawlers to not scrape sections of the site's content, despite Perplexity claiming the opposite. Perplexity also lists the IP address ranges and user agent strings of their web crawlers publicly, but according to Wired and Robb Knight, they use undisclosed IP addresses and spoofed user agent strings when ignoring robots.txt. [ 11 ] [ 58 ] In response, Srinivas stated that Perplexity is not ignoring robots.txt, but suggested it relied on third-party web crawlers that do. [ 59 ] When asked, Srinivas declined to say that Perplexity would cease scraping Wired content using third parties. [ 59 ] In August 2025, Cloudflare published research finding that Perplexity was using undeclared \"stealth\" web crawlers to bypass web application firewalls and robots.txt files intended to block Perplexity crawlers. [ 12 ] [ 60 ] Cloudflare's CEO Matthew Prince tweeted that Perplexity acts \"more like North Korean hackers\" than like a reputable AI company. [ 61 ] Perplexity publicly denied the claims, calling it a \"charlatan publicity stunt\".

    "Reddit - The heart of the internet Skip to main content Go to perplexity_ai r/perplexity_ai r/perplexity_ai Welcome to the Perplexity Reddit community – we’re so excited to have you here! Unlock the power of knowledge with information discovery and sharing. Members • aravind_pplx Nederlands Italiano Magyar Srpski Română Türkçe Suomi ไทย Filipino Message from Aravind, Cofounder and CEO of Perplexity news Hi all - This is Aravind, cofounder and CEO of Perplexity. Many of you’ve had frustrating experiences and lots of questions over the last few weeks. Want to step in and provide some clarity here. Firstly, thanks to all who cared to point out all the product feedback. We will work hard to improve things. Our product and company grew really fast and we now have to uplevel to handle the scale and continue to ship new things while keeping the product reliable. Some explanations below: Why Auto mode? - All AI products right now are shipping non-stop and adding a ton of buttons and dropdown menus and clutter. Including us. This is not sustainable. The user shouldn't have to learn so much to use a product. That's the motivation with \"Auto\" mode. Let the AI decide for the user if it's a quick-fast-answer query, or a slightly-slower-multi-step pro-search query, or slow-reasoning-mode query, or a really slow deep research query. The long-term future is that. An AI that decides the amount of compute to apply to a question, and maybe clarify with the user, when not super sure.  Our goal isn't to save money and scam you in any way. It's genuinely to build a better product with less clutter and simple selector for customization options for the technically adept and well-informed users.. This is the right long-term convergence point. Why are the models inconsistent across modes and why don't I see a model selector on Settings as before? Not all models apply to every mode. Eg: o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 don't make sense in the context of Pro Search. They are meant to reason and go through chain-of-thought and summarize; while models like Sonnet-3.7 (no thinking mode) or GPT-4o are meant to be really great summarizers with quick-fast-reasoning capabilities (and hence good for Pro searches). If we had the model selector in the same way as before, this just leads to more confusion as to which model to pick for what mode. As for Deep Research, it's a combination of multiple models that all work together right now: 4o, Sonnet, R1, Sonar. There's absolutely nothing to control there, and hence, why no model choice offered. How does the new model selector work? Auto doesn't need you to pick anything. Pro is customizable. Pro will persist across follow-ups. Reasoning does not, but we intend to merge Pro and Reasoning into one single mode, where if you pick R1/o3-mini, chain-of-thought will automatically apply. Deep Research will remain its own separate thing. The purpose of Auto is to route your query to the best model for the given task. It’s far from perfect today but our aim is to make it so good that you don’t have to keep up with the latest 4o, 3.7, r1, etc. Infra Challenges : We're working on a new more powerful deep research agent that thinks for 30 mins or more, and will be the best research agent out there. This includes building some of the tool use and interactive and code-execution capabilities that some recent prototypes like Manus have shown. We need a rewrite of our infrastructure to do this at scale. This meant transitioning the way we do our logging and lookups, and removing code written Python and rewriting it in GoLang. This is causing us some challenges we didn't foresee on the core product. You the user shouldn't ideally even need to worry about all this. Our fault. We are going to deprioritize shipping new features at the pace we normally do and just invest into a stable infrastructure that will maximize long-term velocity over short-term quick ships. Why does Deep Research and Reasoning go back to Auto for follow-ups? - Few months ago, we asked ourselves “What stops users from asking follow-up questions?” Given we can’t ask each of you individually, we looked at the data and saw that 15-20% of Deep Research queries are not seen at all bc they take too long; many users ask simple follow-ups. As a result, this was our attempt at making follow-ups fast and convenient. We realize many of you want continued Reasoning mode for your work, so we’re planning to make those models sticky. To do this, we’ll combine the Pro + Reasoning models as “Pro”, which will be sticky and not default to Auto. Why no GPT-4.5? - This is an easier one. The decoding speed for GPT-4.5 is only 11 tokens/sec (for comparison, 4o does 110 tokens/sec (10x faster) and our own Sonar model does 1200 tokens/sec (100x faster)). This led to a subpar experience for our users who expect fast, accurate answers. Until we can achieve speeds similar to what users expect, we will have to hold off on providing access to this model. Why are there so many UI bugs & things missing/reappearing? - We’re always working to improve the answer experience with redesigns, like the new Answer mode . In the spirit of shipping so much code and launching quickly, we’ve missed the mark on quality, leading to various bugs and confusion for users. We’re unapologetic in trying new things for our users, but do apologize for the recent dip in quality and lack of transparency (more on that below). We’re implementing stronger processes to improve our quality going forward. Are we running out of funding and facing market pressure to IPO ? No. We have all the funding we've raised, and our revenue is only growing. The objective behind Auto mode is to make the product better, not to save costs. If anything, I have learned it's better to communicate more transparently to avoid the any incorrect conclusions. Re IPO: We have no plans of IPOing before 2028. The above is not a comprehensive response to all of your concerns and questions but a signal that we hear you and we’re working to improve. It’s exciting and truly a privilege to have you all on this journey to build the best answer engine. Lastly, to provide more transparency and insight into what we’re working on, I’ll be planning on hosting an AMA on Reddit in April to answer more of your questions. Please keep an eye out for a follow-up announcement on that! Until next time, Aravind Srinivas & the Perplexity team Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.

    "Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas, PhD 21, on why he ditched pitch decks - Haas News | Berkeley Haas October 21, 2025 School News Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas, PhD 21, on why he ditched pitch decks By Stella Kotik After years interning and working as a researcher at companies like Google, DeepMind, and OpenAI, Aravind Srinivas, PhD 21 (computer science), realized he needed to be his own boss. “Some people are unemployable. They just don’t listen to what the boss tells them to do,” Srinivas co-founder, president, and CEO of Perplexity AI , joked at a recent Dean’s Speaker Series talk. “I’m one of them.” Watch the video of Srinivas’ talk: Now, he said, Perplexity’s customers are the boss. “‘This is not good.’ ‘That’s not good.’’’ Every day I wake up, my phone has hundreds of these (messages) because I see across all these different social platforms, and that’s how I know, every day, there’s some work to do.” Founded in 2022, Perplexity’s chatbot search engine now logs more than 300 million queries a week. With a mission to “serve the world’s curiosity,” the company recently released Comet, an AI-powered web browser that integrates an AI assistant directly into its users browsing experience. Srinivas’ path toward entrepreneurship began during his PhD in computer science at UC Berkeley. He was drawn to the idea that both business and computer science start with an idea that you have to convince others to believe in, he said, whether that’s through writing a research grant or pitching to investors.  “I’ve always looked up to entrepreneurs,” he said. “Driving change the way you think should be done can only be truly done as an entrepreneur.” Srinivas said what distinguishes Perplexity from legacy search engines isn’t its infrastructure but its approach toward search. Rather than rely on keywords, ads, or clickbait, the platform aims to answer questions with direct, reliable answers. This question-answer philosophy carries into the Perplexity workplace, too, where Srinivas said he starts meetings with questions, not presentations. He uses the same approach with investors. “I’ve never done a pitch deck for any of the other Perplexity funding rounds,” he said. “I just write a memo, and I tell them, ‘You can do a Q&A and ask whatever you want. I’ll spend two hours with you, ask me all the questions you have, and we’re just going to pull the metrics for whatever you have and show you right there. And anything else that is internal, not internal data, you can ask Perplexity. It already knows everything.’…I’m not exaggerating.” Throughout his time as a tech leader, Srinivas said he’s learned to accept imperfection. “I used to think every problem just needed to be fixed instantly,” he said. “As the company has scaled, I have learned to make peace with some problems just existing. That is the number one skill you need as a CEO or a founder.” By releasing products that are 80% perfect, Perplexity has been able to adapt to the quickly developing AI market, he said. Each release becomes a foundation for improvement as his team continues to refine products over time. To Srinivas, resilience also means redefining failure and never giving up. He said too many people avoid risks because they worry about losing or how others might perceive them, when in reality, most potential critics aren’t paying attention. “There’s really nothing to lose from taking risks,” he said. Listen to Srinivas’ talk on the Dean’s Speaker Series Podcast: TRANSCRIPT ALEX MAS : What a turnout. I’m Alex Mas. I’m here—I’m associate dean for academic affairs here at UC Berkeley Haas, and I’m here stepping in for Dean Chatman, who was called away. I am so thrilled to have Aravind Srinivas here today. Let’s give him a huge welcome. And also, welcome back to Berkeley. Aravind obtained his PhD in computer science here at Cal, home of many luminaries who developed the foundations of machine learning in AI, such as Professor Pieter Abbeel and Michael Jordan. A couple of facts about Berkeley. I’m speaking to an audience of one right now, but UC Berkeley is the No. 1 university in the world in venture-backed startups, according to PitchBook. Stanford will say they’re the No. 1 per capita, to which I say, who cares about per capita. We do impact at scale here, and scale is what Perplexity is all about. They’re doing AI at scale. As CEO, Aravind leads Perplexity with a user base of over 30 million active users and 780 million inquiries and counting. Amazing for three years. I’ll just say I am one of those 30 million users. I’ve used the Perplexity Voice Assistant, and it’s just such a great product. Aravind is an exemplar of Questioning the Status Quo, as well as other Defining Leadership Principles. In a recent conversation with Yamini Rangan, CEO of HubSpot and a proud Haas alumna and board member, Aravind shared that curiosity is the key to success in business. It’s what drives innovation and progress. I couldn’t agree more. It exemplifies what we call at Haas the human edge of innovation. We’re training the first generation of AI native business leaders who understand that AI’s true power lies not just in technology, but embodying the deeply human skills of curiosity, judgment, and creativity. It’s about asking better questions and using AI as a tool for meaningful innovation, keeping humanity at the center of technological progress. We are so thrilled to have Aravind with us today, and I’m going to turn it over to our excellent panel who I’d like you to just do one round quickly to introduce yourselves and what you do here at Haas. Thank you so much. GONZA VÁSQUEZ : Hi, everyone. Hi, Aravind. I’m Gonza. I’m a second-year full-time MBA student from Peru. I also happen to be one of the Haas Tech Club co-presidents, and it’s an honor to be here with you today. ARAVIND SRINIVAS : Thank you. REY YRUEGAS ALMANZA : Hi, everyone. My name is Rey. I’m a full-time MBA student from Mexico, and you have no idea how excited we all are. We’re all avid Perplexity users and Comet users as well. So, we’re just really grateful for you being here. ARAVIND SRINIVAS : Thank you. Firstly, I’m super excited to be here. I wish I did this before I did the Stanford GSB event, but better late than never. Back to the OGs. Yeah. GONZA : Aravind worked as a researcher for OpenAI and DeepMind, and for a lot of people, that would be a dream job. But you choose to leave that space and start your own thing. So what was the signal or realization that made you take that leap? ARAVIND SRINIVAS : Well, some people are unemployable. They just don’t listen to what the boss tells them to do. I’m one of them. So that’s the true reason why. What would it look like if I didn’t have a boss so that I could—of course, for your own accountability and staying sane, you need to have something to keep you under check. And for me, it’s the users. Whatever they tell me, ‘The product sucks.’ ‘This is not good.’ ‘That’s not good.’ Every day I wake up, my phone has hundreds of these because I see across all these different social platforms, and that’s how I know, every day, there’s some work to do. You’ve not made it yet. And I keep going. But yeah, jokes aside, I’ve always looked up to entrepreneurs. I think the spirit of driving change the way you see should be done can only be truly done as an entrepreneur. One of my entrepreneurial inspirations has been Larry Page, the founder of Google. And there is a particular thing he said, which is, ‘If you truly want to do something very impactful in the world, there’s probably only two career paths that you can. One is an academic. You become a professor, you have a lab and you get some funding. You get great students, and you try to change the world through your research, or you start a company.’ And pretty much the same thing. ‘You go to VCs, you ask for funding, you try to get a good group of initial founding team and drive the change that you want to bring in. Any other thing, it’s pretty hard to do in a way that you want to do.’ And I definitely didn’t want to be an academic forever for many reasons. Obviously, one is it’s pretty hard to actually get funded, especially in the current climate. So I think startups was something I definitely look for doing. GONZA : And what did you struggle the most with that transition from researcher to CEO? ARAVIND SRINIVAS : Interestingly, it’s not as disconnected as it looks like. And that’s the thing. When I explain to people, they get it. But on the surface level, it doesn’t make sense. Both research and in startups, you’re essentially trying to convince people to work with you. You have to start with a contrarian insight, an unconventional idea. No one wants to read a paper that’s telling them obvious things. And reviewers wouldn’t accept it in an event—in a conference, anyway. You have to write grants for your professor at some point. First year, university covers you, but second year, third year, you do have to help the professor write grants and bring in funding. Same thing. You have to talk to VCs and help you get funding. If you want to do bigger projects, you need to have junior students also help you there. You need to hire people and founding team to help you up. You have to market your research. It’s not important to just get a paper accepted in a conference and go do a poster or an oral presentation. You actually need to have other people building on your work. That’s how you gain your currency in the academic world. Citations. If your paper is not cited by other people, especially important people, your papers are not that useful. Same thing in startups. Your products, whether it’s consumer or enterprise, you need to have customers. You need to have users. And then you need to build on top of what you have. You can’t stop with one paper and then move on. You need to have a line of work. That’s how you make your name in the field. Same thing with startups. In fact, I would say in startups, the line of work, the incrementality, the additional work that keeps going, the iterations, is even more. But the last thing, the most important thing, there’s a lot of suffering in both. Delayed reward, the concept of delayed reward. You are writing—you’re working on a line of research. You have no idea if it’s going to work. If you already knew it, there’s nothing interesting in it. Same thing with startups. You have a thesis of why this could be an interesting product to build. No one knows if it’s really going to work. And so that concept of dealing with suffering and delayed reward and having that intrinsic motivation, everything is built in a research career. So I would say I was actually very well-prepared for startups by being in academia as a researcher. ALEX MAS : Aravind, we have a little bit of a complaint for you. Basically, when we were preparing this chat, Gonza and I sat down and did a bunch of research. And we said, ‘We get it now. We know what to talk about.’ However, Perplexity would launch a new product. And then Perplexity would buy a new company. So I think our question is, how do you lead such an agile and ever-changing organization? ARAVIND SRINIVAS : Well, firstly, necessity is the mother of invention. I don’t have a choice. It’s pretty brutal out there. So just to survive in this fast-moving AI world, we have to keep moving fast. We have to ship a lot of things. We have to constantly—so the most interesting thing in AI, which is very different from other eras, is previous times, you would have a pretty stable infrastructure and tooling to build around. And so you can build around that. You don’t have to think about, ‘What would be the infrastructure six months from now?’ and try to build for it today. That’s the difference in AI. You have to build imperfect products, not perfect products. You have to build products that 80% work. It cannot be 60% because no one’s going to use it. The retention will be zero after 12 weeks. You have to build 80% perfect products where there is a long tail of 20% that kind of doesn’t work, but that 80% is enough for users to get excited about it. And six months from now, that 80/20 goes to 90/10, and 12 months from now, it goes to 95/5. And that’s how you win the market one or two years from now. You have to start with something imperfect today, and you have to have a vision for where it will be, like the state of AI will be six months or 12 months from now. So that’s always been the hard part, and that’s what we tend to focus on. For example, everyone’s talking about our Comet browser, which we made generally available last week. It’s a world’s first agentic browser. You can go and do stuff for you, pull in your personal context and stuff like that. We started to work on it one year ago when we decided to buy a small browser team and start working on agents. Agents was such a buzzword for two years prior to that. No one cracked it. Everyone thought, ‘It’s just a buzzword, nothing’s going to work.’ But we knew that reasoning models were beginning to make progress. OpenAI released the o1 model. O1 was laughed at. Everyone made fun of OpenAI for that. But we knew that three or four iterations from now, it will get there, which is where it is today. But you cannot start working on the browser today. You’ll be late. You would launch it one year later, and by the time, it’s too late. So we started working on it last year. So now we got to work on things that one year from now will be great, and I don’t quite know what it is yet. So yeah. GONZA : You mentioned in a previous interview that the way you inform your vision is you say, ‘I don’t want to know what’s going to change in the world in the next five to 10 years. I want to know what is not going to change in the world in that period.’ ARAVIND SRINIVAS : ‘To be rigorous.’ That is from Bezos. He said it. I liked it, and I’m saying it, too. Yeah. GONZA : Thanks for highlighting the copyright. What is it that you think is going to be that it’s not going to be a change for? ARAVIND SRINIVAS : Yeah, so that’s kind of actually what shaped our product values and also the company culture is speed. No one’s going to ask for a slower product, even if the answer is complicated, even if you’re prompt, is so complicated that it would take two hours or a week of research for a human to do, people still want quick, fast answers. And faster the product, the lower the infrastructure costs. And so it’s going to increase your margin profile, too. So there’s no questions asked. No one’s going to ask for a less accurate product. Hallucinations are always going to be a problem. Hallucinations should always be a bug for a product that aims to give you accurate answers or do stuff for you. You don’t want an agent that makes mistakes 20% of the time. And no one’s going to ask for a crappy user experience. Everybody wants a delightful UI. It should feel magical when you use the product. So these are things we focus on, like speed, accuracy, and world class",

TOI Tech Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Oct 27, 2025, 10:57 IST Share AA + Text Size Small Medium Large Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas is challenging Google's internet dominance with the launch of its new Comet AI browser. This follows Perplexity's $34.5 billion offer to buy Google Chrome, aiming to foster AI-powered search competition. The Chromium-based Comet browser integrates AI tools for productivity and research, offering a familiar user experience. Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas is once again promoting the companyâs newly launched Comet AI browser to end Google âs dominance on the internet. In a post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Indian-origin CEO of the AI startup shared a short clip of the new Comet browser that Perplexity launched last month and wrote: âInternet is too important to be left in Googleâs hands.â This comes after the company offered to buy the popular Chrome browser from Google for $34.5 billion. Later on, Perplexity launched its own AI-powered browser, Comet, to rival Google Chrome. The AI-based web browser is built on the Chromium open-source framework and claims to offer users a familiar experience. Why Perplexity wanted to buy Chrome from Google In August, Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion all-cash offer to acquire Google's Chrome browser. The three-year-old startup confirmed it sent the formal bid to Google, despite being valued at $18 billion itself. As Chrome has over 3 billion users worldwide, it wouldâve been a notable asset for Perplexity in the competition for AI-powered search dominance. Google Photos AI Update: Hands-Free Photo Editing Perplexityâs $34.5 billion proposal included commitments to address regulatory and user concerns. The company plans to invest $3 billion over two years in Chrome development and infrastructure, maintain Chromium as open source, and leave Chromeâs default search settings unchanged. The offer came at a time when the US Department of Justice was seeking to force Google to sell Chrome after a judge ruled that the company held an illegal monopoly in internet search. At that time, DOJ argued that divesting Chrome would prevent Google from controlling a key access point to search and open opportunities for rival engines. What we know about Perplexityâs new Comet browser Last month, Perplexity launched the Comet browser, which is built on the Chromium framework. It supports Chrome extensions and bookmarks while adding AI-based tools for productivity, research, and task management. Comet includes an AI sidebar assistant that can summarise articles, draft emails, manage schedules, and automate tasks directly within the browser. It also introduces workspaces for organising tabs and projects, personalised recommendations, and features like email prioritisation, content generation, and real-time fact-checking. Comet is currently available in India for Perplexity Pro users on Windows and macOS, with Android pre-orders open and iOS support in progress. Perplexity has partnered with Bharti Airtel to offer a one-year free Pro subscription to encourage adoption.

    "Perplexity founder Aravind Srinivas shares number 1 skill needed to be CEO, and it's not what you might think | Company Business News View Market Dashboard Perplexity founder Aravind Srinivas shares number 1 skill needed to be CEO, and it's not what you might think Aravind Srinivas shared his thoughts on the most important skill needed to be a CEO, Perplexity's products, his approach to business and investors. For the AI company's funding rounds, the startup founder says he eschews presentations for direct Q&A sessions. Jocelyn Fernandes Updated 23 Oct 2025, 04:35 PM IST Aravind Srinivas shared his thoughts on the most important skill needed to be a CEO, Perplexity's products, his approach to business and meeting with investors. ( Bloomberg / File Photo ) Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity's co-founder, president, and CEO, Aravind Srinivas , believes that it takes one key skill to be chief of a company — “make peace with problems existing”, i.e. the ability to accept imperfection. Speaking at a recent Dean’s Speaker Series talk at UC Berkeley Haas, Srinivas shared his thoughts on the most important skill needed to be a CEO, Perplexity's products, his approach to the business and towards investors. For example, for the AI company's funding rounds, the startup founder says he eschews presentations for direct Q&A sessions. He also shared that Perplexity thrives by releasing products that are 80% perfect and then improving by adapting to the market needs.

As the company has scaled, I have learned to make peace with some problems just existing. That is the number one skill you need as a CEO or a founder,” he stated. The line of thinking also extends to his company, where Perplexity strives to release products that are 80% perfect, which can then be improved by quickly adapting to the developing AI market, he added. Srinivas also believes that in a fast-paced industry such as AI , “There’s really nothing to lose from taking risks.” Watch: Aravind Srinivas at UC Berkeley Haas Also Read | ‘Those wanting to buy BMWs…’: Amitabh Kant buys Mahindra XEV9 amid Lokpal row No pitch deck, Aravind Srinivas takes direct approach to investors For meetings at Perplexity, Srinivas says he eschews presentations and decks for question-answer sessions. And the same approach carries with investors . “I’ve never done a pitch deck for any of the other Perplexity funding rounds. I just write a memo, and I tell them, ‘You can do a Q&A and ask whatever you want. I’ll spend two hours with you, ask me all the questions you have, and we’re just going to pull the metrics for whatever you have and show you right there. And anything else that is internal, not internal data, you can ask Perplexity . It already knows everything.’…I’m not exaggerating,” he told the audience. Also Read | Weather live updates: IMD predicts heavy rain in Tamil Nadu, Andhra, Karnataka On being a “boss” and driving change as an entrepreneur Srinivas said he started his own venture as he is “unemployable”. He joked during the talk, “Some people are unemployable. They just don’t listen to what the boss tells them to do. I’m one of them.” He however added that he still has a “boss” now — the customers. “Now, Perplexity’s customers are the boss. Every day I wake up, my phone has hundreds of these (messages) because I see across all these different social platforms, and that’s how I know, every day, there’s some work to do,” he added. The founder also believes that true entreprenuership drives change. “I’ve always looked up to entrepreneurs . Driving change the way you think should be done can only be truly done as an entrepreneur,” he added.

A tweet by an X user about using Perplexity AI’s Comet browser to complete an online course has received numerous responses, including one from the company’s CEO, Aravind Srinivas. Aravind Srinivas, co-founder and CEO of Perplexity AI, recently became India's youngest Indian billionaire. (File Photo) It all started when the X user, whose profile says he is a web developer, shared a video showing Comet being used to complete a Coursera course. The user later added that ironically the course was on “ AI Ethics, Responsibility and Creativity.” Also Read: Aravind Srinivas stuns Nikhil Kamath: ‘I’m actually the first…' The video shared by the techie captured Comet answering the questions and completing the course. The individual posted, “Just completed my Coursera course,” thanking Srinivas, Perplexity, and Comet AI. Reacting to the tweet, which received over three lakh views, Srinivas said, “Absolutely don’t do this.” Aravind Srinivas' reply to a Perplexity Comet AI user. (Screengrab (X)) How did social media react? An individual posted, “Thanks for creating Frankistein's monster. I want it on my Linux laptop. When can I get it?” Another added, “Oh… but they will. Companies are more likely to get candidates who use tools like this to juice their resume than actual talent with integrity. It’s a good problem, though. It should induce a greater awareness of meritocratic evaluation methodologies.” Also Read: Indian-origin man left Google, became ChatGPT’s nightmare; It all started with a mother’s dream A third remarked, “If my company knew about this, they'd never allow Comet.” A fourth wrote, “The very purpose of education is lost here.

He recently became the youngest billionaire in India, according to the Hurun India Rich List 2025. The list estimated his net worth at ₹ 21,190 crore. “The M3M Hurun India Rich List 2025 chronicles India’s shift from a services-centric past to a deep-tech, product-led powerhouse. The debut of Aravind Srinivas, 31, founder of Perplexity, as the youngest billionaire, underscores this transformation — his wealth stems from building a foundational AI model competing globally,” the Hurun report noted. An alum of IIT Madras, he has dual degrees in Electrical Engineering and a PhD in Computer Science. Before founding his own company, he worked at some big tech companies, including OpenAI, Google, and DeepMind. He started Perplexity AI with Denis Yarats, Johnny Ho, and Andy Konwinski in 2022.
