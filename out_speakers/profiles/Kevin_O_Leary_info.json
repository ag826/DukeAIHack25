    "Kevin O'Leary - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Canadian businessman and author (born 1954) This article is about the Canadian businessman. For other uses, see Kevin O'Leary (disambiguation) . Kevin O'Leary O'Leary in 2023 Born Terrence Thomas Kevin O'Leary ( 1954-07-09 ) July 9, 1954 (age 71) Montreal , Quebec , Canada Other names Mr. Wonderful Citizenship Canada Ireland United Arab Emirates Alma mater University of Waterloo ( BES ) University of Western Ontario ( MBA ) Occupation(s) Businessman, investor, author, television personality Known for Reality TV host, CNBC and BNN contributor Political party Conservative (2004–present) Liberal (before 2004) Spouse Linda Greer ​ ( m. 1990) ​ Children 2 Website kevinoleary .com Terrence Thomas Kevin O'Leary (born July 9, 1954), also known as Mr. Wonderful , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] is a Canadian businessman and television personality. [ 3 ] From 2004 to 2014, he appeared on various Canadian television shows, including the business news programs SqueezePlay and The Lang and O'Leary Exchange , as well as the Canadian reality television shows Dragons' Den and Redemption Inc. [ 4 ] In 2008, he appeared on Discovery Channel 's Project Earth . Since 2009, he has appeared on Shark Tank , the American version of Dragons' Den . O'Leary co-founded SoftKey Software Products , a technology company that sold software geared toward family education and entertainment. During the late 1980s and 1990s, SoftKey became a major consolidator in the global educational software market, having acquired rival companies via hostile takeover bids, such as Compton's New Media, the Learning Company , and Broderbund . SoftKey later changed its name to The Learning Company and was acquired by Mattel in 1999, surprising many financial observers, who viewed O'Leary's company as a house of cards. [ 5 ] Nevertheless  the sale netted O'Leary around six million dollars. [ 6 ] [ 5 ] Mattel promptly fired O'Leary. The acquisition resulted in significant losses for The Learning Company and sparked multiple shareholder lawsuits targeting O'Leary's mismanagement. [ 5 ] In 2017, he campaigned to be the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] He dropped out in April 2017, one month before the election , citing a lack of support in Quebec . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In addition to his native Canadian citizenship, O'Leary also holds Irish and Emirati citizenship. Early life and education [ edit ] O'Leary was born on 9 July 1954, [ 11 ] in Montreal , one of two sons of Georgette (née Bookalam; Arabic : جورجيت بوكلام ), a small-business owner and investor of Lebanese descent, and Terry O'Leary, a salesman of Irish descent. Kevin also has a brother, Shane O'Leary. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Due to his paternal heritage, O'Leary also holds Irish citizenship and carries an Irish passport. [ 16 ] O'Leary has dyslexia , which he argued helped him in the world of business. [ 17 ] O'Leary grew up in Mount Royal, Quebec . [ 4 ] His parents divorced when he was a child, largely due to his father's alcoholism. [ 11 ] His father died shortly after that, when O'Leary was only seven. [ 18 ] After his father's death, his mother ran the family's clothing business as an executive. [ 19 ] His mother later married an economist, George Kanawaty, [ 20 ] who worked with the UN's International Labour Organization . [ 14 ] [ 21 ] His stepfather's international assignments caused the family to move frequently, and O'Leary lived in many places while growing up, including Cambodia , Ethiopia , Tunisia , and Cyprus . [ 22 ] In his youth, he met both Haile Selassie of Ethiopia and Pol Pot of Cambodia. [ 23 ] O'Leary attended Stanstead College [ 24 ] and St. George's School , both in Quebec. [ 4 ] O'Leary's mother was a skilled investor, investing a third of her weekly paycheque in large-cap, dividend-paying stocks and interest-bearing bonds, ultimately achieving high returns in her investment portfolio. She kept her investment portfolio secret, so O'Leary only discovered his mother's skill as an investor after her death when her will was executed. [ 25 ] Many of his investment lessons came from his mother, including the admonition to save one-third of his money. [ 4 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] O'Leary had aspired to become a photographer, but on the advice of his stepfather who prompted the young Kevin to be more realistic with his future career aspirations, ultimately led him to attend university, [ 21 ] where he continued to develop his interest in business and investing since his youth. [ 28 ] He received an honours bachelor's degree in environmental studies and psychology from the University of Waterloo in 1977 [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] and an MBA in entrepreneurship from Ivey Business School at the University of Western Ontario in 1980. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Business career [ edit ] In 1978, between the first and second years of his MBA program, O'Leary was selected for an internship at Nabisco in Downtown Toronto and then worked as an assistant brand manager for Nabisco's cat food brand. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 32 ] O'Leary attributed his future business success at The Learning Company as a result of the extensive marketing skills that he honed during his assistant brand management days at Nabisco. [ 33 ] After leaving Nabisco, O'Leary began a brief career as a television producer. With two of his former MBA classmates, Scott Mackenzie and Dave Toms (both of whom had assisted on O'Leary's MBA documentary), O'Leary co-founded Special Event Television (SET). [ 19 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] SET was an independent television production company that produced original sports programming such as The Original Six , Don Cherry's Grapevine, and Bobby Orr & The Hockey Legends . The company achieved limited success with minor television shows, soccer films, sports documentaries, and short in-between-period commercials for local professional hockey games. [ 5 ] [ 26 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] One of his partners later bought out his share of the venture for $25,000. [ 4 ] [ 35 ] Softkey [ edit ] After selling his SET share, O'Leary then proceeded by moving onto his next business venture. He started Softkey in a Toronto basement in 1986, along with business partners John Freeman and Gary Babcock. [ 38 ] The company was a publisher and distributor of CD-based personal computer software for Windows and Macintosh computers. A major financial supporter who had committed $250,000 in investment capital to finance O'Leary's company backed out the day before signing the documents and delivering his cheque, leaving O'Leary to go elsewhere to seek the necessary funding sources that he needed to support his fledgling business. Desperate to secure funding, O'Leary turned to using the proceeds that he gained from selling his SET share while also convincing his mother to lend him $10,000 in seed capital to establish SoftKey Software Products. [ 39 ] As the software and personal-computer industries were proliferating throughout the course of the early 1980s, O'Leary convinced printer manufacturers to bundle Softkey's program with their hardware. With distribution assured, the company developed several educational software products focused on mathematics and reading education. Softkey products typically consisted of software for home users, especially compilation discs containing various freeware or shareware games packaged in \"jewel-case\" CD-ROMs. [ 5 ] [ 27 ] Softkey weathered stiff competition from other software companies in the late 1980s and prospered throughout the 1990s. By 1993, Softkey had become a major consolidator in the educational software market, acquiring rivals such as WordStar and Spinnaker Software in the process. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] In 1995, Softkey acquired The Learning Company (TLC) for $606 million, [ 42 ] adopting its name, and moved its headquarters to Cambridge, Massachusetts . TLC lost $105 million (US) in 1998 on revenues of $800 million and suffered losses over the previous two years. [ 43 ] TLC bought its former rival Broderbund in June 1998 for $416 million. In 1999, TLC was acquired by Mattel for US$4.2 billion. [ 38 ] Following the acquisition, sales and earnings for Mattel soon dropped, and O'Leary was fired. The purchase by Mattel was later called one of the most disastrous corporate acquisitions in recent business history. [ 44 ] While acquisition management had projected a post-acquisition profit of US$50 million, Mattel actually experienced a loss of US$105 million. Mattel's stock dropped, wiping out US$3 billion of shareholder value in a single day. Mattel's shareholders later filed a class-action lawsuit accusing Mattel executives, O'Leary, and former TLC CEO Michael Perik of misleading investors about the health of TLC and the benefits of its acquisition. The lawsuit alleged that TLC used accounting tricks to hide losses and inflate quarterly revenues. In response, O'Leary and his defendants disputed all of the charges, with Mattel later paying $122 million to settle the lawsuit in 2003. O'Leary blamed the technology meltdown and a culture clash of management of the two companies for the failure of the acquisition. [ 43 ] [ 45 ] O'Leary and financial backers from Citigroup made an unsuccessful attempt to acquire the French video game company Atari , with O'Leary having made plans to start a video-gaming television channel which never materialized. [ 5 ] StorageNow Holdings [ edit ] In 2003, O'Leary became a co-investor and corporate director at StorageNow Holdings, a Canadian developer of climate-controlled storage facilities controlled by Reza and Asif Satchu . [ 46 ] StorageNow became the largest operator of storage services in Canada, with facilities in 11 cities, and was acquired by Storage REIT in March 2007 for $110 million. [ 5 ] O'Leary later sold his shares which yielded a windfall profit exceeding $4.5 million through realized capital gains, with his initial stake being originally valued at $500,000. [ 5 ] In May 2005, Reza Satchu and O'Leary's operating partner, Wheeler, filed a $10-million wrongful dismissal lawsuit, charging that they had altered an agreed-upon compensation deal and illegally reduced Wheeler's share of the profits. [ 5 ] O'Leary and Satchu claimed Wheeler failed to reach performance targets. [ 47 ] The case was settled out of court. [ 5 ] Other ventures [ edit ] In March 2007, O'Leary joined the advisory board of Genstar Capital , a private equity firm that focuses on investing in health care, industrial technology, business services, and software. Genstar Capital appointed O'Leary to its Strategic Advisory Board to seek new investment opportunities for its $1.2 billion fund. [ 48 ] O'Leary Funds [ edit ] In 2008, O'Leary co-founded O'Leary Funds Inc., a mutual fund management firm focused on global yield investing. He is the company's chairman and lead investor, while his brother Shane O'Leary serves as the director. The fund's assets under management grew from $400 million in 2011 to $1.2 billion in 2012. [ 49 ] The fund's primary manager was Stanton Asset Management, a firm controlled by the husband-and-wife team of Connor O'Brien and Louise Ann Poirier. [ 27 ] According to research by Canadian banker Mark R. McQueen , O'Leary's fund increased distribution yield from his funds by returning invested capital to shareholders. While this is not unusual, it was contrary to O'Leary's statements. [ 50 ] Another analysis also found that one-quarter of the distributions from one of O'Leary's funds were return of capital. [ 47 ] In November 2014, O'Leary Funds Management agreed to pay penalties to the Autorité des marchés financiers for violating certain technical provisions of the Securities Act. At the time of the agreement, O'Leary Funds reported taking steps to correct the violations. [ 51 ] On October 15, 2015, O'Leary Funds was sold to Canoe Financial, a private investment-management company owned by Canadian businessman W. Brett Wilson . Wilson once was an investor with O'Leary on CBC's Dragons' Den. [ 52 ] O'Leary Ventures [ edit ] O'Leary is also the founder of O'Leary Ventures, a private early-stage venture capital investment company, [ 53 ] O'Leary Mortgages, O'Leary books, and O'Leary Fine Wines. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] In April 2014, O'Leary Mortgages closed. [ 56 ] O'Leary's funds have a questionable history and are said to have declined over 20% in a year, often a big blow to fund managers. O'Leary no longer manages outside money. [ 57 ] ETF and investing [ edit ] On July 14, 2015, O'Leary launched an Exchange-traded fund (ETF) through O'Shares Investments, a division of his investment fund, O'Leary Funds Management LP where O'Leary serves as chairman. A value investor , he has advised on personal finance . [ 58 ] He advocates portfolio diversification and suggests that investors have their age as the percentage of bonds in their portfolios (i.e., 30% in bonds and 70% in stocks for a 30-year-old investor, with an increasing proportion of bonds and decreasing proportion of stocks as the investor ages). [ 58 ] O'Leary has also \"stated on many occasions that he won't invest in publicly-traded stock unless it pays him a dividend .\" [ 59 ] O'Leary is also an active gold investor , with five percent of his financial portfolio invested in physical gold. However, he does not invest in stocks of gold-mining companies because he says cash flow is an important investment factor to him. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] O'Leary also advises diversification in multiple industry sectors while dedicating no more than 20 percent of one's financial portfolio being concentrated in one sector. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Cryptocurrency [ edit ] O'Leary initially expressed skepticism about cryptocurrency, describing bitcoin as \"a digital game\" and \"useless currency\" in 2019. He illustrated his thinking with the following example, \"Let's say you want to buy a piece of Swiss real estate for $10 million in bitcoin...The seller wants a guarantee that the bitcoin value comes back to the U.S. currency. You have to somehow hedge the risk of bitcoin. That means it's not a real currency. That means the receiver is not willing to take the risk of the volatility it has. It's worthless.\" [ 65 ] In May 2021, O'Leary said he had made a 3 to 5% allocation to bitcoin and had become a strategic investor in the Vancouver -based decentralized finance platform Defi Ventures; [ 66 ] the company then renamed itself WonderFi Technologies, in reference to O'Leary's nickname, \"Mr. Wonderful\". In August 2021, it was announced O'Leary would take an ownership stake in the parent companies of FTX.com and FTX.US as part of his compensation for becoming a \"spokesperson and ambassador\" for FTX . [ 67 ] FTX subsequently went bankrupt due to CEO Sam Bankman-Fried secretly using client funds to make speculative bets that were unsuccessful. In November 2022, O'Leary, alongside other spokespeople for FTX, was sued in a class-action lawsuit. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] There is precedent for prosecutin",

WonderTrust Ivey Business School at Western University Websites Company Website http://kevinolearyventures.com Company Website http://olearyventures.com Company Website http://olearyventures.com Report this profile About Kevin O'Leary's success story starts where most entrepreneurs begin: with a big idea and zero cash. From his basement, he launched SoftKey Software Products. As sales took off, Kevin moved to headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and went on an industry consolidating acquisition binge. From 1995 to 1999 he bought out almost every one of his software competitors, including Mindscape, Broderbund and the Learning Company in the industry's first vicious public hostile battle. Shareholders loved his take-no-prisoners, cost cutting style and fueled him with billions to do his deals. In 1999 Kevin sold his company to the Mattel Toy Company for $4.2 billion, one of the largest deals ever done in the consumer software industry. To keep his money working hard, he took control of his wealth from his lackluster money managers and founded his own mutual fund company, O'Leary Funds. He raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors who share his \"get paid while you wait\" yield oriented, value investing philosophy. He shares his tips and tribulations with a national television audience and turns The Street upside down in the process. As a self-proclaimed \"Eco-preneur,\" Kevin looks hardest for investments that make money - and are environmentally friendly. When he's not squeezing the market from his office, he travels the world looking for new opportunities to deploy his capital. He is on the investment committee of Boston's prestigious 200-year-old Hamilton Trust. He launched O’Shares ETFs, a group of exchange traded funds. He is O'Shares Chairman.

If you're going to be an entrepreneur, my thesis is that you have to sacrifice everything for some period in your life to be successful.

    "Kevin O'Leary | Shark Tank Skip to Content ABOUT Kevin O'Leary Shark Shark Biography As the son of a travelling ILO executive, Kevin O'Leary lived and was educated in Cambodia, Cyprus, Tunisia, Ethiopia, France and Switzerland. After receiving his Master of Business Administration, he founded Special Event Television, an independent production company producing such original sports programming as \"The Original Six,\" \"Don Cherry's Grapevine\" and \"Bobby Orr and the Hockey Legends.\" In 1986, O'Leary founded SoftKey Software Products (later called The Learning Company), the first software company to apply the principles of consumer goods marketing to the software industry. SoftKey grew quickly as the price of personal computers declined, and millions of American families began to buy software for education and entertainment. SoftKey soon became a catalyst of consolidation in the software industry, raising over $1 billion in financing and completing a series of aggressive acquisitions, including WordStar International, Spinnaker Software, Compton's New Media, The Learning Company, Creative Wonders, the Minnesota Educational Computing Company, Mindscape and Broderbund. By 1998, O'Leary's company was the undisputed world leader in educational, reference and home productivity software, and the world's second–largest consumer software company, with annual sales over $800 million, 2,000 employees and offices in 15 countries. In 1999, Mattel acquired the company for $4.2 billion. In 2003, O'Leary co-founded Storage Now, a leading developer of climate–controlled storage facilities. Through development projects and acquisitions, Storage Now soon had operations in 11 cities, serving such companies as Merck and Pfizer, and was acquired by In Storage REIT in March 2007 for $110 million. In 2007, O'Leary became a founding investor and director of Boston–based Stream Global Services Inc., focused on the growing outsourcing business services market. Today, O'Leary leads the O'Leary Financial Group – a group of companies that includes O'Shares Investment Advisers, O'Leary Ventures and a continually growing roster of other businesses. He is also the founder and chief sommelier of O'Leary Fine Wines, an award-winning wine label, as well as a member of Boston's 107-year-old Hamilton Trust. In addition to \"Shark Tank,\" O'Leary co-hosted Discovery Channel's \"Project Earth\" television series that explored the financial implications of global climate change, and he is a regular contributor on CNBC. O'Leary is an avid guitarist, photographer and author. He has written three bestselling books, including \"Cold Hard Truth on Men, Women and Money,\" and most recently, \"Cold Hard Truth on Family, Kids and Money.\" Meet the Cast Meet the Cast Barbara Corcoran Shark Lori Greiner Shark Robert Herjavec Shark Daymond John Shark Daniel Lubetzky Shark Shark Tank Cast Kevin O'Leary Follow Shark Tank:",
    "‘Shark Tank's Kevin O’Leary: Women make me the most money Skip Navigation Markets Business Investing Tech Politics Video Watchlist Investing Club PRO Livestream Menu Kevin O'Leary on ABC's \"Shark Tank\" with the founders of Wicked Good Cupcakes Adam Taylor | ABC | Shark Tank Over the course of his career as an entrepreneur and investor, Kevin O'Leary , star of ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" has noticed a trend in his top performing investments: They're businesses owned or run by women. \"I've been investing now for over 10 years on things like 'Shark Tank' deals — and other deals that are brought to me because of 'Shark Tank' — and the majority of my returns come from the companies run by women,\" O'Leary tells CNBC Make It of his portfolio. \"Now this isn't some kind of academic research, this is real data. This is real money coming back to me,\" he adds. For example, O'Leary says an investment in Wicked Good Cupcakes , founded by mother-daughter duo Tracey Noonan and Danielle Vilagie, is one of the most lucrative he's made on \"Shark Tank.\" Courtesy of Kevin O'Leary Sara Margulis, who landed a deal with O'Leary on season six of \"Shark Tank\" as the CEO and co-founder of Honeyfund , a platform for crowdfunding honeymoons, says the success of women-led ventures has lead O'Leary to be proactive about funding women. \"Of all the sharks, he's someone who really has noticed that in his portfolio all of his returns are coming from women-led or women-owned companies,\" Margulis tells CNBC Make It. \"He has a huge amount of respect for when a woman walks into 'Shark Tank.' \"The returns are the returns and they speak for themselves,\" says Margulis. Here are three reasons why O'Leary says women excel at entrepreneurship. 1. Time management watch now VIDEO 5:15 05:15 Honeyfund: Crowdfunding for newlyweds Squawk Box \"If you want something done, give it to a busy mother. That's an old adage and it's true in business,\" O'Leary says. The time taken away from work to raise children, or the \"motherhood penalty,\" is often cited as a contributor to the pay disparity between men and women, and numbers bear that out: The earnings of women who have children fall behind men by 20 percent due to time away from their careers, according to a 2018 working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which analyzed data from Denmark. But for entrepreneurs, O'Leary says the multi-tasking abilities of someone who's balanced child rearing with a career are a huge advantage. \"Women are very good at allocating their time, so they know what to do not only with their time, but with their employees' [time,]\" he explains. \"A lot of my companies that are small, average size, 25 employees, [so] it really matters what everybody is doing.\" Margulis, a mother herself, agrees: \"[Moms] already know how to time manage, we already know how to juggle all the balls,\" she says. \"We're getting the kids to school, or making the lunches. We're setting up the doctor's appointments, we're taking [the kids to] Little League. We already have so much happening in our lives that it is very natural to wear so many hats, and I think that for women, that translates really well into the workplace.\" 2. Setting realistic goals watch now VIDEO 3:08 03:08 Sweet success for Wicked Good Cupcakes Squawk Box O'Leary also sees women leaders set more realistic goals for their companies. And that's key for creating a successful work environment, he says. \"In my portfolios, women hit their objectives in sales 95 percent of the time,\" he says. \"Men only 65 percent. \"What's going on there, and why should you care?\" says O'Leary. \"Men are setting goals, in my case anyways, much, much higher and then only achieve them 65 percent of the time.\" If employees aren't meeting their goals, that frustration can lead to turnover, which is particularly costly for small operations. Women are better at avoiding this pitfall, he says. \"When you meet your goals 95 percent of the time, you change the culture of your business. People feel they're working in a winning organization,\" O'Leary says. \"That's why women are doing better in business — they keep their people. The staff are sticky. They want to work there because they're hitting their goals.\" O'Leary says it's a tip for setting goals anyone can use in their career: \"You don't have to reach for the stars, you want to win 95 percent of the time. That's the secret sauce.\" 3. Listening to critique watch now VIDEO 5:18 05:18 College entrepreneurs pitch ideas to 'Shark Tank's' Kevin O'Leary. Here's how they fared Squawk Box \"Lastly, women listen,\" O'Leary says. \"Who are you serving when you're running a business? Number one your customers, number two your employees and number three your shareholders,\" O'Leary says, and to succeed, executives need to listen to everyone. That's something women excel at, especially with critical feedback. \"They listen to all of them, they take the advice, they take the information and they pivot,\" O'Leary says. \"Understanding when you're going in the wrong direction is the tell of a great entrepreneur. Women are very good at listening, assimilating and redirecting, and that's how you make it in business.\" Of course, women entrepreneurs still encounter many obstacles. Among the firms doling out venture capital funding — the main avenue for start-ups to get money — women represent 11 percent of decision makers, according to a the most recent 2016 report from the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) and Deloitte . And only 12 percent of venture capital dollars go to founding teams with at least one female member, according to data provided to CNBC Make It by PitchBook, which studies market data. But for O'Leary, investing in women-built businesses has been a key to success. \"I can't express how much I'm inspired by the business women I've had the pleasure of partnering with on ['Shark Tank'],\" O'Leary tweeted on International Women's Day March 8. \"They impress me more every day with their innovation, strength, and tenacity!\" tweet Don't miss: Kevin O'Leary: Unless you can pass this two-question test, don't buy a home Like this story?
