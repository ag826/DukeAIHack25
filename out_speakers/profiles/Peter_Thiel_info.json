[ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] A co-founder of PayPal , Palantir Technologies , and Founders Fund , he was the first outside investor in Facebook . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] According to Forbes , as of May 2025, Thiel's estimated net worth stood at US$20.8 billion, making him the 103rd-richest individual in the world. [ 10 ] Thiel has been described as \"perhaps America's leading public intellectual today,\" [ 11 ] or \"intellectual architect of Silicon Valley's contemporary ethos\". [ 12 ] Others debate the consistency or morality of his views. [ 13 ] [ N 1 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Born in Germany, Thiel was taken to the US by his parents when he was one year old. In 1971, his family moved to South Africa then South West Africa , [ 17 ] before moving back to the US in 1977. [ 17 ] After graduating from Stanford, he worked as a clerk, a securities lawyer, a speechwriter, and subsequently a derivatives trader at Credit Suisse . He founded Thiel Capital Management in 1996 and co-founded PayPal with Max Levchin and Luke Nosek in 1998. He was the chief executive officer of PayPal until its sale to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Following PayPal, Thiel founded Clarium Capital , a global macro hedge fund based in San Francisco. [ 18 ] In 2003, he launched Palantir Technologies, a big data analysis company, and has been its chairman since its inception. In 2005, Thiel launched Founders Fund with PayPal partners Ken Howery and Luke Nosek. Thiel became Facebook's first outside investor when he acquired a 10.2% stake in the company for $500,000 in August 2004. He co-founded Valar Ventures in 2010, founded Thiel Capital in 2011, co-founded Mithril Capital in 2012, was investment committee chair, in 2012, and was a part-time partner at Y Combinator from 2015 to 2017. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] He was granted New Zealand citizenship in 2011, which later became controversial in New Zealand. Variously described as a conservative libertarian and democracy-skeptic authoritarian , Thiel has made substantial donations to American right-wing figures and causes. Through the Thiel Foundation , Thiel governs the grant-making bodies Breakout Labs and Thiel Fellowship . In 2016, when the Bollea v. Gawker lawsuit ended up with Gawker losing the case, Thiel confirmed that he had funded Hulk Hogan . Gawker had previously outed Thiel as gay. Early life and education See also: Stanford Review Peter Andreas Thiel was born in Frankfurt am Main , Hesse , then part of West Germany , on 11 October 1967, to Klaus Friedrich Thiel and his wife Susanne Thiel. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] The family emigrated to the United States when Peter was one year old and lived in Cleveland , Ohio, where his father worked as a chemical engineer . [ 5 ] Klaus worked for various mining companies, which created an itinerant upbringing for Thiel and his younger brother, Patrick Michael Thiel. [ 25 ] Thiel and his mother later naturalized as U.S. citizens, whereas his father did not. [ 24 ] [ 26 ] Before settling in Foster City, California , in 1977, the Thiel family lived in South Africa and South West Africa (modern-day Namibia ) in the time of apartheid . Peter changed elementary schools seven times. He attended for two years a German-language school in Swakopmund that required students to wear uniforms and utilized corporal punishment , such as striking students' hands with a ruler. He said this experience instilled a distaste for uniformity and regimentation later reflected in his support for individualism and libertarianism . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The German community in Swakopmund was known at the time for its continued glorification of Nazism . [ 17 ] Thiel was noted as a smart, but lonely, withdrawn boy, with whom others would not mingle because they knew he would not stay long in the town. [ 29 ] Thiel played Dungeons & Dragons and was an avid reader of science fiction , with Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein among his favorite authors. He is a fan of J. R. R. Tolkien 's works, stating as an adult that he had read The Lord of the Rings over ten times. [ 30 ] Thiel has founded six firms ( Palantir Technologies , Valar Ventures , Mithril Capital, Lembas LLC, Rivendell LLC and Arda Capital) with names originating from Tolkien. [ 31 ] Thiel excelled in mathematics and scored first in a California-wide mathematics competition while attending Bowditch Middle School in Foster City . [ 32 ] At San Mateo High School , he read Ayn Rand and, influenced by his parents, admired Nixon and Reagan . [ 33 ] He was valedictorian of his graduating class in 1985. [ 32 ] [ 34 ] When at school, he reportedly charged $500 each to take the SAT for underclassmen , knowing this would cost him his spot at Stanford if discovered. [ 33 ] Thiel studied philosophy at Stanford University . The replacement of a \" Western Culture \" program at Stanford with a \"Culture, Ideas and Values\" course that addressed diversity and multiculturalism prompted Thiel to co-found The Stanford Review , a conservative and libertarian newspaper, in 1987. The paper received funding from Irving Kristol . [ 35 ] Thiel was The Stanford Review's first editor-in-chief until he graduated in 1989. Thiel has maintained his relationship with the paper, consulting with staff and donating to the newspaper. [ 36 ] According to Marc Andreessen , Thiel's time at the Review marked the beginning of a career-long strategy: using provocative verbal cues – later delivered through talks, books and mottos – as a way to attract capable individuals to his projects, preferring this method over actively seeking out talent. The Review has spawned a large network of industry leaders, among whom Andrew Granato and the Fortune respectively identify around 300 people who have worked for or received investment from Peter Thiel or Joe Lonsdale , another prominent editor-in-chief and Thiel's mentee. A number of Review alumni have also become public officials, beginning with Jay Bhattacharya and Paula M. Stannard who were editors during Thiel's time as editor-in-chief. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] After graduation, Thiel attended Stanford Law School , graduating in 1992 with a Juris Doctor degree. [ 40 ] While at Stanford, Thiel met René Girard , whose mimetic theory influenced him. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Career Early career After graduating from Stanford Law School, Thiel was a law clerk to Judge James Larry Edmondson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit from 1992 to 1993. [ 43 ] Thiel then worked as a securities lawyer for Sullivan & Cromwell in New York. He left the law firm in under a year. [ 44 ] He then took a job as a derivatives trader in currency options at Credit Suisse in 1993 while also working as a speechwriter for former United States secretary of education William Bennett . Thiel returned to California in 1996. [ 45 ] Upon returning to the Bay Area , Thiel capitalized on the dot-com boom . With financial support from friends and family, he raised $1 million toward the establishment of Thiel Capital Management and embarked on his venture capital career. Early on, he experienced a setback after investing $100,000 in his friend Luke Nosek 's unsuccessful web-based calendar project. Soon thereafter, Nosek's friend Max Levchin described to Thiel his cryptography -related company idea, which became their first venture called Fieldlink (later renamed Confinity ) in 1998. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] PayPal Further information: PayPal § Early history With Confinity, Thiel realized they could develop software to bridge a gap in making online payments. Although the use of credit cards and expanding automated teller machine networks provided consumers with more payment options, not all merchants had the necessary hardware to accept credit cards. Thus, consumers had to pay with exact cash or check. Thiel wanted to create a type of digital wallet for consumer convenience and security by encrypting data on digital devices, and in 1999 Confinity launched PayPal . [ 48 ] PayPal promised to open up new possibilities for handling money. Thiel viewed PayPal's mission as liberating people from the erosion of the value of their currencies due to inflation. [ 49 ] [ N 2 ] When PayPal launched at a press conference in 1999, representatives from Nokia and Deutsche Bank sent $3 million in venture funding to Thiel using PayPal on their PalmPilots . PayPal then continued to grow through mergers in 2000 with Elon Musk 's online financial services company X.com , and with Pixo , a company specializing in mobile commerce. These mergers allowed PayPal to expand into the wireless phone market and transformed it into a safer and more user-friendly tool by enabling users to transfer money via a free online registration and email rather than by exchanging bank account information. PayPal went public on 15 February 2002 and was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October of that year. [ 51 ] Thiel remained CEO of the company until the sale. [ 9 ] His 3.7% stake in the company was worth $55 million at the time of acquisition. [ 52 ] In Silicon Valley circles, Thiel is colloquially referred to as the \"Don of the PayPal Mafia \". [ 53 ] Clarium Capital Further information: Clarium Capital Thiel used $10 million of his proceeds to create Clarium Capital Management , a global macro hedge fund focusing on directional and liquid instruments in currencies, interest rates, commodities, and equities. [ 54 ] Thiel stated that \"the big, macroeconomic idea that we had at Clarium—the idée fixe —was the peak-oil theory , which was basically that the world was running out of oil, and that there were no easy alternatives.\" [ 32 ] In 2003, Thiel successfully bet that the United States dollar would weaken. [ 55 ] In 2004, Thiel spoke of the dot-com bubble having migrated, in effect, into a growing bubble in the financial sector, and specified General Electric and Walmart as vulnerable. In 2005, Clarium saw a 57.1% return as Thiel predicted that the dollar would rally. [ 56 ] [ 55 ] However, Clarium faltered in 2006 with a 7.8% loss. Thereafter, the firm sought to profit in the long-term from its petrodollar analysis, which foresaw the impending decline in oil supplies. [ 57 ] Clarium's assets under management grew after achieving a 40.3% return in 2007 to more than $7 billion by the first quarter of 2008, but fell later in the year and again in 2009 after financial markets collapsed. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] By 2011, after missing out on the economic rebound, many key investors pulled out, reducing the value of Clarium's assets to $350 million, two thirds of which was Thiel's money. [ 60 ] Palantir Further information: Palantir Technologies In May 2003, Thiel incorporated Palantir Technologies, a big data analysis company named after the Tolkien artifact. [ 61 ] He continues as its chairman, as of 2022. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Thiel stated that the idea for the company was based on the realization that \"the approaches that PayPal had used to fight fraud could be extended into other contexts, like fighting terrorism\". He also stated that, after the September 11 attacks , the debate in the United States was \"will we have more security with less privacy or less security with more privacy?\". He envisioned Palantir as providing the government the technology to find terrorism without operating illegally. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Palantir's reputation is controversial. Although the software only analyzes data collected by the customers, some criticize it for enabling surveillance. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ N 3 ] [ 69 ] Professor Vasilis Galis notes that the software is not a mere tool, but shapes policing culture with new policing norms. [ 70 ] [ N 4 ] According to Geoff Shullenberger (managing director of Compact ) and Moira Weigel (Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature, Harvard), Peter Thiel and Alex Karp built Palantir on the basis of their understanding of Leo Strauss and the Frankfurt School . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Facebook Further information: Facebook § Thefacebook, Thiel investment, and name change After the first meeting with Zuckerberg in August 2004,  Thiel made a $500,000 angel investment in the startup (then \"a three-person dormroom\") for a 10.2% stake in the company and joined Facebook's board. This was the first outside investment in Facebook and valued the company at $4.9 million. He also bought Zuckerberg a car. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] The investment was originally in the form of a convertible note , to be converted to equity if Facebook reached 1.5 million users by the end of 2004. Although Facebook narrowly missed the target, Thiel allowed the loan to be converted to equity anyway. [ 76 ] Thiel said of his investment: \"I was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision. And it was a very reasonable valuation. I thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment.\" [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 74 ] Facebook employees reported that Thiel's influence was unusual for a board member who was not also the CEO. Some criticized Thiel for pushing his mentee Zuckerberg and the company to the right. [ 78 ] Zuckerberg credited Thiel with helping him time Facebook's 2007 Series D, which closed before the 2008 financial crisis . [ 79 ] Facebook's initial public offering was in May 2012, with a market cap of nearly $100 billion ($38 a share), at which time Thiel sold 16.8 million shares for $638 million. [ 80 ] In August 2012, immediately upon the conclusion of the early investor lock-up period, Thiel sold almost all of his remaining stake for between $19.27 and $20.69 per share, or $395.8 million, for a total of more than $1 billion. [ 81 ] In 2016, he sold a little under 1 million of his shares for around $100 million. In November 2017, he sold another 160,805 shares for $29 million, putting his holdings in Facebook at 59,913 Class A shares. [ 82 ] As of April 2020, he owned less than 10,000 shares in Facebook. [ 83 ] On 7 February 2022, Thiel announced he would not stand for re-election to the board of Facebook owner Meta at the 2022 annual stockholders' meeting and would leave after 17 years in order to support pro– Donald Trump candidates in the 2022 United States elections . [ 63 ] [ 84 ] Founders",

    "The Education of a Libertarian | Cato Unbound Skip to main content The Education of a Libertarian Tweet Like Submit Share I remain committed to the faith of my teenage years: to authentic human freedom as a precondition for the highest good. I stand against confiscatory taxes, totalitarian collectives, and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual. For all these reasons, I still call myself “libertarian.” But I must confess that over the last two decades, I have changed radically on the question of how to achieve these goals. Most importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible. By tracing out the development of my thinking, I hope to frame some of the challenges faced by all classical liberals today. As a Stanford undergraduate studying philosophy in the late 1980s, I naturally was drawn to the give-and-take of debate and the desire to bring about freedom through political means. I started a student newspaper to challenge the prevailing campus orthodoxies; we scored some limited victories, most notably in undoing speech codes instituted by the university. But in a broader sense we did not achieve all that much for all the effort expended. Much of it felt like trench warfare on the Western Front in World War I; there was a lot of carnage, but we did not move the center of the debate. In hindsight, we were preaching mainly to the choir — even if this had the important side benefit of convincing the choir’s members to continue singing for the rest of their lives. As a young lawyer and trader in Manhattan in the 1990s, I began to understand why so many become disillusioned after college. The world appears too big a place. Rather than fight the relentless indifference of the universe, many of my saner peers retreated to tending their small gardens. The higher one’s IQ, the more pessimistic one became about free-market politics — capitalism simply is not that popular with the crowd. Among the smartest conservatives, this pessimism often manifested in heroic drinking; the smartest libertarians, by contrast, had fewer hang-ups about positive law and escaped not only to alcohol but beyond it. As one fast-forwards to 2009, the prospects for a libertarian politics appear grim indeed. Exhibit A is a financial crisis caused by too much debt and leverage, facilitated by a government that insured against all sorts of moral hazards — and we know that the response to this crisis involves way more debt and leverage, and way more government. Those who have argued for free markets have been screaming into a hurricane. The events of recent months shatter any remaining hopes of politically minded libertarians. For those of us who are libertarian in 2009, our education culminates with the knowledge that the broader education of the body politic has become a fool’s errand. Indeed, even more pessimistically, the trend has been going the wrong way for a long time. To return to finance, the last economic depression in the United States that did not result in massive government intervention was the collapse of 1920–21. It was sharp but short, and entailed the sort of Schumpeterian “creative destruction” that could lead to a real boom. The decade that followed — the roaring 1920s — was so strong that historians have forgotten the depression that started it. The 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics. Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of “capitalist democracy” into an oxymoron. In the face of these realities, one would despair if one limited one’s horizon to the world of politics. I do not despair because I no longer believe that politics encompasses all possible futures of our world. In our time, the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms — from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called “social democracy.” The critical question then becomes one of means, of how to escape not via politics but beyond it. Because there are no truly free places left in our world, I suspect that the mode for escape must involve some sort of new and hitherto untried process that leads us to some undiscovered country; and for this reason I have focused my efforts on new technologies that may create a new space for freedom. Let me briefly speak to three such technological frontiers: (1) Cyberspace . As an entrepreneur and investor, I have focused my efforts on the Internet. In the late 1990s, the founding vision of PayPal centered on the creation of a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution — the end of monetary sovereignty, as it were. In the 2000s, companies like Facebook create the space for new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states. By starting a new Internet business, an entrepreneur may create a new world. The hope of the Internet is that these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order. The limitation of the Internet is that these new worlds are virtual and that any escape may be more imaginary than real. The open question, which will not be resolved for many years, centers on which of these accounts of the Internet proves true. (2) Outer space . Because the vast reaches of outer space represent a limitless frontier, they also represent a limitless possibility for escape from world politics. But the final frontier still has a barrier to entry: Rocket technologies have seen only modest advances since the 1960s, so that outer space still remains almost impossibly far away. We must redouble the efforts to commercialize space, but we also must be realistic about the time horizons involved. The libertarian future of classic science fiction, à la Heinlein, will not happen before the second half of the 21st century. (3) Seasteading . Between cyberspace and outer space lies the possibility of settling the oceans. To my mind, the questions about whether people will live there (answer: enough will) are secondary to the questions about whether seasteading technology is imminent. From my vantage point, the technology involved is more tentative than the Internet, but much more realistic than space travel. We may have reached the stage at which it is economically feasible, or where it soon will be feasible. It is a realistic risk, and for this reason I eagerly support this initiative. The future of technology is not pre-determined, and we must resist the temptation of technological utopianism — the notion that technology has a momentum or will of its own, that it will guarantee a more free future, and therefore that we can ignore the terrible arc of the political in our world. A better metaphor is that we are in a deadly race between politics and technology. The future will be much better or much worse, but the question of the future remains very open indeed. We do not know exactly how close this race is, but I suspect that it may be very close, even down to the wire. Unlike the world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of individuals may still be paramount. The fate of our world may depend on the effort of a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism. For this reason, all of us must wish Patri Friedman the very best in his extraordinary experiment. Editor’s Note: Mr. Thiel has further elaborated on the question of suffrage here . We copy these remarks below as well: I had hoped my essay on the limits of politics would provoke reactions, and I was not disappointed. But the most intense response has been aimed not at cyberspace, seasteading, or libertarian politics, but at a commonplace statistical observation about voting patterns that is often called the gender gap. It would be absurd to suggest that women’s votes will be taken away or that this would solve the political problems that vex us. While I don’t think any class of people should be disenfranchised, I have little hope that voting will make things better. Voting is not under siege in America, but many other rights are. In America, people are imprisoned for using even very mild drugs, tortured by our own government, and forced to bail out reckless financial companies. I believe that politics is way too intense. That’s why I’m a libertarian. Politics gets people angry, destroys relationships, and polarizes peoples’ vision: the world is us versus them; good people versus the other. Politics is about interfering with other people’s lives without their consent. That’s probably why, in the past, libertarians have made little progress in the political sphere. Thus, I advocate focusing energy elsewhere, onto peaceful projects that some consider utopian. Also from this issue Lead Essay Beyond Folk Activism by Patri Friedman In this month’s lead essay, Patri Friedman charges libertarian activists with falling victim to bias:  Specifically, they seem to suffer from the belief that advocacy and education are enough to change public policy.  Friedman suggests otherwise, and he recommends that much more effort be put into demonstration projects that will show how a libertarian world might work.  Not only will these projects do more than mere persuasion toward winning the war of ideas, but they will also allow individual libertarians to live in a much freer society, and they will exert competitive pressure on existing governments to reform themselves.  Friedman discusses several such projects, including his own, the Seasteading Institute. Response Essays The Many Paths to Libertarianism by Brian Doherty Brian Doherty argues that Patri Friedman is both right in some ways and wrong in others. He’s right when he argues that incentives and technologies largely determine the shape of government today, and create the problems that libertarians tirelessly point out. He’s wrong, however, to dismiss “folk activism” entirely: Not only has it achieved some clear though incremental good, but it also helps create more libertarians, and at some point, this effort seems likely to bear fruit.  Not only that, but seasteading relies on some folk activism itself, in convincing a large number of people that it would be a good idea to try. On the whole, Doherty welcomes seasteading as one of many possible paths to a more libertarian world. Leveraging Institutional Change by Jason Sorens Jason Sorens reviews several important historical developments, including the rise of free trade in the nineteenth century and the growth of the welfare state in the twentieth.  He concludes that structural change matters, and that incentives play a larger role than ideology in determining the type of government we get.  He then considers several of the key challenges of both Seasteading and the Free State Project, as well as a few encouraging developments in recent politics that appear tied to the rise of the Free State movement.  He counsels patience, but also proposes several strategies for moving forward. The Education of a Libertarian by Peter Thiel Peter Thiel shares the belief that politics is mostly futile, a conclusion he reached after years of activism.  In particular, he believes that democratic politics is unlikely to bring about libertarian outcomes.  Fortunately, politics is just one sphere of human life, and it’s possible, he argues, to create technologies that minimize its reach.  Thiel describes a “deadly race” between politics and technology, in which human freedom is the prize.  The goal of libertarian activism should not be to win in politics, he argues, but to escape it.

References to pop culture and literature Do Thiel’s arguments make sense? Peter Thiel , the billionaire political svengali and tech investor, is worried about the antichrist. It could be the US. It could be Greta Thunberg . Over the past month, Thiel has hosted a series of four lectures on the downtown waterfront of San Francisco philosophizing about who the antichrist could be and warning that Armageddon is coming. Thiel, who describes himself as a “small-o orthodox Christian”, believes the harbinger of the end of the world could already be in our midst and that things such as international agencies, environmentalism and guardrails on technology could quicken its rise. It is a remarkable discursion that reveals the preoccupations of one of the most influential people in Silicon Valley and the US. Peter Thiel’s off-the-record antichrist lectures reveal more about him than Armageddon Read more “A basic definition of the antichrist: some people think of it as a type of very bad person. Sometimes it’s used more generally as a spiritual descriptor of the forces of evil,” Thiel said, kicking off his first lecture. “What I will focus on is the most common and most dramatic interpretation of antichrist: an evil king or tyrant or anti-messiah who appears in the end times.” Timeline Peter Thiel's lectures on the antichrist, summarized Show Peter Thiel divided his four lectures on the antichrist under loose banners of subject matter. After listening to recordings of his off-the-record talks, the Guardian has summarized each lecture by synthesizing them into a format easier to follow than his meandering musings. The timeline below consists of the title of each lecture, the question Thiel is attempting to answer within it, and the conclusion he comes to, accompanied by representative quotes. 15 September 2025 Lecture 1: “Knowledge shall be increased” Question: What is the antichrist’s relationship to Armageddon? Answer: The antichrist, whom Thiel believes is some sort of evil tyrant, will come to power by constantly talking about the existential threats of technology and science to the world. They will use this prognostication to gain some type of unifying global power and force the complete stagnation of technological and scientific progress which he says is already stagnant. Quote: “The antichrist comes to power by talking constantly about Armageddon, about rumours of wars and scaring you into giving him control over science and technology,\" said Thiel. \"We have sort of an answer in late modernity, which is that the antichrist will come to power by talking about Armageddon non-stop. Matthew 24:6: ‘You shall hear of wars and rumours of wars.’ If you think of it not in the timelessly eternal but in the one-time world historical way, it's sequence. The rumors come after the wars or they're escalations from the wars. In some ways, we got the answer already in Los Alamos,” he said. 22 September 2025 Lecture 2: “Empire and the antichrist’s relation to government” Question: What kinds of government are antichrist-like in nature? Quote: “Last time I talked about Daniel 12:4 – ’knowledge shall be increased in the end times.’ Tonight I will explore the other half of this prophecy, that ‘many shall run to and fro,’ which I read, much like Francis Bacon did, as a prophecy about globalization, empire, and the dangers of a one-world state,” Thiel said. Answer: There are several forms of either anti-science, pro-science, anti-Christian or pro-Christian governments represented in literature that show the various forms that an antichrist-like government can take. These dynamics change throughout modern history. He zeros in on four books: Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’s Watchmen, and Eiichiro Oda’s manga One Piece, which embody various stances in favor of or against science and Christianity. Quote: “You can at least identify the antichrist in literature. I'm going to try to illustrate this change in history through these four books,” said Thiel. 29 September 2025 Lecture 3: “How one person can take over the world and the velocity at which that person has to move to do so” Question: How can the antichrist, a single mortal person, achieve world domination? Answer: They can do it if they’re young – or – get rich young, since “money has this remarkable velocity”. Quote: “Tonight, I’ll continue this investigation by asking the seemingly narrow question of the velocity of the antichrist. What I mean by that is: the Bible says that one man will take over the entire world. He only has one lifetime to do that. How on earth can he achieve that?” 6 October 2025 Lecture 4: “The new Rome” Question: Where today might we find the antichrist's new Roman Empire? Answer: According to the Bible, the Roman Empire served as the katechon , or the place that will restrain an antichrist figure, and provided law and order, which in turn prevented or delayed the coming of the apocalypse. Thiel says the modern-day katechon is likely in America. One possibility is San Francisco, partly because of its distance from Washington DC, which would make it harder for there to be a fusion of too many powers like the federal government and the technology industry. Ironically, though, he says America is also likely the place with the most markings of a future one-world order. Quote: \"It's just that America is, at this point, the natural candidate for katechon and antichrist, ground zero of the one-world state, ground zero of the resistance to the one-world state.” Thiel was on the forefront of conservative politics long before the rest of Silicon Valley took a rightward turn with Donald Trump ’s second term as president. He’s had close ties to Trump for nearly a decade, is credited with catapulting JD Vance into the office of vice-president, and is bankrolling Republicans’ 2026 midterm campaigns. Making his early fortune as a co-founder of PayPal, he has personally contributed to Facebook as its first outside investor, as well as to SpaceX, OpenAI and more through his investment firm, Founders Fund. Palantir , which he co-founded, has won government contracts worth billions to create software for the Pentagon, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and the National Health Service in the UK. Now, with more attention and political pull than ever, the billionaire is looking to spread his message about the antichrist, though he is better known for his savvy politics and investments than his contributions to theology. “I’m a libertarian, or a classical liberal, who deviates in one minor detail, where I’m worried about the antichrist,” Thiel said during his third lecture. The meandering gospel of Peter Thiel’s talks, which began on 15 September and ended on Monday, were long and sweeping, mingling biblical passages, recent history and philosophy and sometimes deviating into conspiracy theories. He peppered them with references to video games and TV shows along with musings on JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. He likewise recalled conversations with Elon Musk and Benjamin Netanyahu and spoke at length about how he thinks Bill Gates is “a very, very awful person”. Tickets for the series went for $200, selling out within hours. Attenders were told that the lectures were strictly off the record and that they were forbidden from taking photos, videos or audio recordings. At least one person who took notes and published them had his ticket revoked by a post on X . Guardian reporters did not attend the lectures or agree to the off-the-record stipulation. Recordings were provided by an attender who gave them on the condition of anonymity. When reached for comment, Thiel’s spokesperson, Jeremiah Hall, did not dispute the veracity of the material given to the Guardian. Hall did correct a piece of the Guardian’s transcription and clarified an argument made by Thiel about Jews and the antichrist. The Silicon Valley heavyweight drew on a wide swath of religious thinkers, including the French-American theorist René Girard, whom Thiel knew at Stanford University, and the Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt, whose work he said helped create the core of his own beliefs. He credited the English Catholic theologian John Henry Newman as the inspiration for his four-part series, saying: “Newman did four, so I’m doing four. I’m happy about it.” The venture capitalist has hosted and attended events and lectured on the topic for decades, going back to the 1990s, according to a report by Wired . In recent months, he has spoken to theologians and podcasters about the antichrist both publicly and in private. His beliefs are diffuse, meandering and often confusing, but one tenet he’s steadfastly maintained over the years is that the unification of the world under one global state is essentially identical to the antichrist. In his talks, he uses the term “antichrist” almost interchangeably with “one-world state”. “One world or not, in a sense is the same as the question antichrist or Armageddon. So in one sense, it’s completely the same question,” he said. His version of history, and its potential end, posits technology as a central driver of societal change and takes a Christianity-focused, Eurocentric view that declines to engage much with other religious movements or parts of the world. On the day of Thiel’s final lecture in San Francisco , as the mostly young and mostly male crowd lined up to get in, a group of about 20 protesters stood out front holding anti-Palantir and anti-Ice signs that said things such as “Predatory tech”, “We do not profit from people who profit from misery” and “Not today Satan”.

Photograph: Dara Kerr/The Guardian A trio of self-described “satanists” dressed in black costumes with goth makeup walked up and down the line of attenders carrying a goblet of red liquid with a small plastic replica of a bone. “Will you bring our dark lord Peter Thiel this baby’s blood?” they asked. Then they performed what they called a “dark ritual”, dancing slowly in a circle to Mozart’s Requiem in D minor, which ended with them writhing on the city sidewalk, and yelling: “Take us to your personal hell … Thank you for being our dark lord.” What do Thiel’s lectures say? The Guardian is publishing substantial quoted passages alongside contextual annotations so that the public may be informed on what an influential figure in politics and technology was saying behind closed doors. He believes the Armageddon will be ushered in by an antichrist-type figure who cultivates a fear of existential threats such as climate change, AI and nuclear war to amass inordinate power. The idea is this figure will convince people to do everything they can to avoid something like a third world war, including accepting a one-world order charged with protecting everyone from the apocalypse that implements a complete restriction of technological progress. In his mind, this is already happening. Thiel said that international financial bodies, which make it more difficult for people to shelter their wealth in tax havens, are one sign the antichrist may be amassing power and hastening Armageddon, saying: “It’s become quite difficult to hide one’s money.” It’s because the antichrist talks about Armageddon non stop. We’re all scared to death that we’re sleepwalking into Armageddon. And then because we know world war three will be an unjust war, that pushes us. We’re going hard towards peace at any price. What I worry about in that sort of situation is you don’t think too hard about the details of the peace and it becomes much more likely that you get an unjust peace. This is, by the way, the slogan of the antichrist: 1 Thessalonians 5:3. It’s peace and safety, sort of the unjust peace. Let me conclude on this choice of antichrist or Armageddon. And again, in some ways the stagnation and the existential risks are complementary, not contradictory. The existential risk pushes us towards stagnation and distracts us from it. How does Thiel think Armageddon will happen? Thiel rarely gives a definitive answer about who exactly the antichrist might be or how Armageddon might come about – a central point across his lectures is that nothing is written in stone or inevitable – but he does give the contours of what a global conflict that could lead to Armageddon might look like. There’s all sorts of different ways, one world or none, antichrist or Armageddon, that I’m tempted to think about this, and here’s one sort of application. In terms of how does one think about the current geopolitical moment. How does one think about the nature of the conflict between the United States and China, the west and China. You don’t really know how it’s going to go. You can ask, are we heading for world war three or cold war two? And if you sort of reflect on the history of the two world wars and the first cold war. But first, if there ever was an unjust war, world war one is an unjust war. If there ever was a just war, world war two was probably a just war, with certain caveats. World war one is really insane. World war two was about as justified as a war can be. I think we can say that if you had an all -out world war three or war between nuclear powers involving nuclear weapons, it would simply be an unjust war. A total catastrophe, possibly literal Armageddon, the end of the world. So world war three will be an unjust war. But then if you have a cold war, you have to distinguish between – can you have a just peace and an unjust peace? Somehow, it’s very strange how the first cold war from ‘49 to ‘89 ended. But it ended with roughly what I think of as a just peace, where somehow you didn’t have a nuclear war. And somehow our side, which I think was more the good side, basically won. And you ended up not with a perfect peace, but more ",

Recommendations received Joe Lonsdale “Peter is one of the greatest minds and greatest leaders of our time.  It is an extraordinary honor to work with him, and what I have learned about finance and about the world has opened up possibilities that I might otherwise never have appreciated.  It's unclear whether it is helpful for various readers of this profile to be aware of the massive global importance of what Peter is likely to accomplish.  Perhaps it is sufficient to say that if he is doing something to create wealth, you would be lucky to be involved ... and if you don't understand or agree with what he's doing, then you might be twice as lucky, because you'd likely learn why you were wrong as you watched him succeed massively.” Keith Rabois “To be successful in Silicon Valley, you need to be contrarian and right.  Although many people describe themselves as contrarian, Peter is one of the few who have earned the distinction.  He also is better than anyone else I have ever worked with at decisively resolving what path to take under conditions of real uncertainty.

    "Peter Thiel on Stagnation, Innovation, and What Not To Name Your Company (Ep. 1 - Live at Mason) | Conversations with Tyler April 6, 2015 Peter Thiel on Stagnation, Innovation, and What Not To Name Your Company (Ep. 1 - Live at Mason) On stagnation, the Bible, company names, chess, favorite TV shows, and the “Straussian Christ.” Subscribe Apple Google Stitcher Spotify YouTube In the first episode of this series, Peter Thiel talks with Tyler Cowen about stagnation, the Bible, company names, chess, favorite TV shows, and even the “Straussian Christ.” Watch the full conversation Read the full transcript TYLER COWEN: Just a minute on the premise of this series. It’s been my view for years now that Peter Thiel is one of the greatest and most important public intellectuals of our entire time. Throughout the course of history, he will be recognized as such. I thought Peter would be absolutely the perfect person to inaugurate this series. Peter himself doesn’t need an introduction; he has a best-selling book. His role in PayPal, Facebook, Palantir, many other companies, is well known. Peter is a dynamo. There is no one like Peter. But the purpose today is to focus on Peter’s views as a public intellectual. The way we run these dialogues are a bit different than usual. It’s not going to be chatty and drawn out. We’ll try to replicate a kind of conversation Peter and I would have with each other. Get right to the point, a lot of quick back and forth, and we’ll see how well we can do that in public. But I’ve watched a lot of interviews with Peter online and we’re going to try to make this different from all those. Let’s start with some questions about stagnation, Peter. At any point, if you care to add other topics of your own, please do so. You’re well known for arguing, well, “they promised us flying cars and all we got is 140 characters”; “technological progress has slowed down.” How is it you think that we’re most likely to get out of the great stagnation, when that happens? PETER THIEL: Yes, I think there are, those three separate things. There’s the question of stagnation, which I think has been a story of stagnation in the world of atoms, not bits. I think we’ve had a lot of innovation in computers, information technology, Internet, mobile Internet in the world of bits. Not so much in the world of atoms, supersonic travel, space travel, new forms of energy, new forms of medicine, new medical devices, etc. It’s sort of been this two-track area of innovation. There are a lot of questions of what has caused it and I think maybe that’s a good part to start in terms of what gets you out of it. On a first cut, I would say that we lived in a world in which bits were unregulated and atoms were regulated. If you are starting a computer software company, that costs maybe $100,000, to get a new drug through the FDA, maybe on the order of a billion dollars or so. If the FDA were regulating video game technologies, and you had to do a double-blind study to make sure that the video games weren’t addictive, damaging to your brain, etc. These things are very overdetermined. It’s driven by many different factors. My narrow attempt to get out of it is not necessarily to come to DC and beg the regulators to be more reasonable. It is just to try to find ways for people to succeed at the margins. Because I think the other thing that has driven the stagnation is the hysteresis. When you have a history of failure, that becomes discouraging and so failure begets failure. No halfway sane parent would encourage their kids to study nuclear engineering today, whereas there are a lot of people going into software. The history of success in software is encouraging more people to go into it and drive more innovation. Then the history of failure in these other areas has been very discouraging. What I think would start, if you got some signal successes in other areas, that can then set a precedent and you can somehow get what’s been a vicious cycle into a virtuous cycle. COWEN: Then if you have to make a prediction, which breakthrough in particular will get us out of the stagnation? What’s your pick? THIEL: I still think there are — probably the most natural ones are all these things that are at the boundary of information technology on atoms, of bits and atoms. COWEN: Artificial intelligence? Biotech? THIEL: AI feels slightly overhyped. Biotech, a lot could happen. It feels heavily regulated. But if you’ve got self-driving cars, that would be a significant innovation which would change a decent amount at the margins. There’s some regulatory challenges with it, but it’s sort of right at the intersection of the kinds of things that could happen. I think the most natural hope is that information technology starts to broaden out and starts to impact this world of atoms. Then we’re going to have this question about whether the technology outpaces the politics or vice versa. COWEN: What number should I keep my eye on? Let’s say you’re going to take a long nap and I need someone to tell me, “Tyler, we’re out of the great stagnation now.” What’s the impersonal indicator that I should look at? THIEL: I disagree with the premise of that question. I don’t think the future is this fixed thing that just exists. I don’t think there’s something automatic about the great stagnation ending or not ending. I think — I always believe in human agency and so I think it matters a great deal whether people end it or not. There was this sort of hyperoptimistic book by Kurzweil, The Singularity Is Near ; we had all these sort of accelerating charts. I also disagree with that, not just because I’m more pessimistic, but I disagree with the vision of the future where all you have to do is sit back, eat popcorn, and watch the movie of the future unfold. I think the future is open to us to decide what to do. If you take a nap, if you encourage everybody else to take a nap, then the great stagnation is never going to end. COWEN: Is there a chance that intellectually we’ve become so complacent that our worldviews have so changed? Some writers have suggested the decline of mainline Protestantism has intellectually changed America forever. The sense of what can be accomplished, our unwillingness to repeat, say, the Manhattan Project, or Apollo. Is it possible we’re simply in that forever, and it’s a downward spiral and the longer you’re in it, the harder it is to get out? It’s not really about bits. THIEL: It’s certainly possible that it’s something like that. But I do think that there’s certainly, at the margins, there always are things that we can do. I am somewhat pessimistic about the possibility of government being a key, a place where the great stagnation gets reversed. There is a sense in which a letter from Einstein to the White House would get lost in the mail room today. You could not even do Apollo. I am somewhat pessimistic about the possibility of government being a key, a place where the great stagnation gets reversed. There is a sense in which a letter from Einstein to the White House would get lost in the mail room today. You could not even do Apollo. Even something like the SDI program in the 1980s. The debate in the ’80s was, it’s a dangerous first-strike weapon versus a great defensive technology, whereas today, people would say that SDI was just this fictional thing that would have never worked. Again, this very odd way that our expectations have been dramatically reduced. But I do think there’s sort of a question about where in the private sector can you coordinate things on a big enough scale. Silicon Valley start-ups have been a way to do it, and maybe there’s some class of somewhat larger companies. My PayPal colleague Elon Musk started both SpaceX and Tesla, which are extremely charismatic businesses, because it involved somewhat larger-scale complex coordination, getting a lot of different pieces together to work. Not as big as we could do, perhaps, if you had a well-functioning government. But I think that’s not really that realistic. COWEN: Given that energy prices are now so low, are you more optimistic about peak oil than you used to be, or do you think that’s a temporary blip on the horizon? THIEL: I’m surprised by how much they’ve collapsed. I would say, they are still higher than they were in 2002, 2003 on the oil side. The jury is still very much out on how well it’s going to work. I think the big question is, what’s the equilibrium price at which fracking is really going to work? We’ve had something like $450 billion has gone into the fracking industry in the last four or five years, and there’s a question whether at $50 a barrel oil, can you actually get a positive return on that money? The striking thing, even as of summer 2014, when oil was still at $100-plus a barrel, was even though you had these two boom stories: you had the Silicon Valley IT story, and you had the fracking, mid-US growth story. The striking thing was always how much smaller the fortunes were that were being made in the fracking industry, which led me to think that somehow, it was not as great an innovation as was happening on the IT side. Or more marginal, harder to get to work. I think if it barely worked at $100, it’ll be very interesting to see how it works at $50. [Editor’s note: The recording was briefly interrupted here. ] THIEL: The intellectual question that I ask at the start of my book is, “Tell me something that’s true that very few people agree with you on.” This is a terrific interview question. Even when people can read on the Internet that you’re going to ask this question to everybody you interview, they still find it really hard to answer. And it’s hard to answer not because people don’t have any ideas. Everyone has ideas. Everyone has things they believe to be true that other people won’t agree with you on. But they’re not things you want to say. COWEN: Peter, tell me something that’s true that everyone agrees with you on. [ laughter ] THIEL: Well there are lots of things that are true that everyone agrees with me on. I think for example even this idea that the university system is somewhat screwed up and somewhat broken at this point. This is not even a heterodox or a very controversial idea anymore. There was an article in TechCrunch where the writer starts with “this is going to be super controversial” and then you look through the comments — there were about 350 comments — they were about 70 percent in my favor. So the idea that the education system is badly broken is not even controversial. You know, the ideas that are really controversial are the ones I don’t even want to tell you. I want to be more careful than that. I gave you these halfway, in-between ideas that are a little bit edgier. But I will also go a little bit out on a limb: I think the monopoly idea, that the goal of every successful business is to have a monopoly, that’s on the border of what I want to say. But the really good ideas are way more dangerous than that. COWEN: Let me give you my take on how I’ve tried to fit different parts of your thought together. And again, for all you listeners, this doesn’t have to be true. It’s just my mental model of Peter Thiel. That you’re one of a lot of thinkers who takes the idea of original sin — it doesn’t have to be a theological commitment — seriously. Tocqueville wrote in the 19th century that America eventually would evolve to be a land of complacent people who were going to stop believing in original sin and stick to a kind of conformist mediocrity. So you have taken this to heart. The world out there is deeply weird. Even though there appears to be free entry into ideas production, because of René Girard–like ideas, the people who deviate, someone comes down on them pretty hard. So there’s excess conformity, the original sin in people’s motives gets magnified at the social level. So basically, there are distortions out there. And everything we can see, it’s a gnostic theology, and a relatively small number of people who can see through those distortions can be great entrepreneurs, or can tell the truth about politics. And it’s all ultimately some kind of bundled, implicitly theological, but not necessarily involving belief in God, but theological perspective about the nature of people. And it ends up spreading to all the different parts of society and that, to me, has been what ties your thought together. But that’s a hypothesis; let’s hear your reaction to that. THIEL: Let’s see. I think the way original sin normally works is that it resides in individuals, in one way or another. And so theologically, I would place it much more in society. And so I think society is both something that’s very real and very powerful, but on the whole quite problematic. We always run the risk of losing sight of that. I don’t know if it’s strictly the awareness of it that solves it. Certainly, there probably are some people who are just vaguely oblivious to it, so in Silicon Valley, I point out that many of the more successful entrepreneurs seem to be suffering from a mild form of Asperger’s where it’s like you’re missing the imitation, socialization gene. COWEN: And that’s a plus, right? THIEL: It happens to be a plus for innovation, and creating great companies, but I think we always should turn this around as an incredible critique of our society. We need to ask, what is it about our society where those of us who do not suffer from Asperger’s are at some massive disadvantage because we will be talked out of our interesting, original, creative ideas before they are even fully formed? We’ll notice that’s a little bit too weird, that’s a little bit too strange. Maybe I’ll just go ahead and open the restaurant that I’ve been talking about, that everyone else can understand and agree with, or do something extremely safe and conventional, and therefore hypercompetitive, and probably not that great as an idea. I’d say a lot of these people may not understand this larger theory about society, but they are somewhat oblivious to it, and it pushes progress. Now, certainly my own experience would have been a little bit more where — I grew up in Northern California. It was this hyper-tracked process, where my eighth grade junior high school yearbook, one of my friends wrote in, “I know you’re going to get into Stanford in four years.” Four years later I got into Stanford, then I got into Stanford Law School. You won all the conventionally tracked competitions; you ended up at a big law firm in Manhattan. From the outside, it was a place where everybody wanted to get in. On the inside, it was a place where everybody wanted to get out. You ask one of the people down the hall from me, said that it was great to see me leave. I left after seven months and three days, it was great to see me leave. It was like “I had no idea it was possible to escape from Alcatraz.” COWEN: What did you learn there? THIEL: I learned that I was incredibly prone to this problem of social conve",

    "Interview with Peter Thiel, Billionaire Investor and Company Creator (#28) - The Blog of Author Tim Ferriss “Freedom lies in being bold.” — Robert Frost This episode’s guest is the incredible Peter Thiel . Ep 28: Peter Thiel, Billionaire Investor and Company Creator on Investing, Business, and Life Peter is a serial company founder (PayPal, Palantir), billionaire investor (first outside investor in Facebook, 100+ others), and author of the new book Zero to One . Whether you’re an investor, entrepreneur, or simply a free thinker aspiring to do great things, I highly recommend you grab a copy. His teachings on differentiation, value creation, and competition alone have helped me make some of the best investment decisions of my life (e.g. Twitter, Uber, Alibaba, etc.). This podcast episode was experimental, as I was on medical leave.  It includes both audio and written questions. What are Peter’s favorite books?  Thoughts on tech and government, and more?  Answers to these “bonus questions” can be found in the text below. Listen to the episode on Apple Podcasts , Spotify ,  or wherever you get your podcasts. You can find the transcript of this episode here . Transcripts of all episodes can be found here . Ep 28: Peter Thiel, Billionaire Investor and Company Creator on Investing, Business, and Life Now, a bit more on Peter… Peter Thiel has been involved with some of the most dynamic companies to emerge from Silicon Valley in the past decade, both as a founder and investor. Peter’s first start-up was PayPal, which he co-founded in 1998 and led to a $1.5 billion acquisition by eBay in 2002. After the eBay acquisition, Peter founded Clarium Capital Management, a global macro hedge fund. Peter also helped launch Palantir Technologies, an analytical software company which now books $1B in revenue per year, and he serves as the chairman of that company’s board. He was the first outside investor in Facebook, and he has invested in more than 100 startups total. There are a lot of lessons in this podcast, even more in his new book , and below are a few follow-up questions that Peter answered via text. Enjoy! TIM: What is the book (or books) you’ve most often gifted to other people? PETER: Books by René Girard, definitely — both because he’s the one writer who has influenced me the most and because many people haven’t heard of him. Girard gives a sweeping view of the whole human experience on this planet — something captured in the title of his masterwork, Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World — but it’s not just an academic philosophy. Once you learn about it, his view of imitation as the root of behavior is something you will see every day, not just in people around you but in yourself. What is your favorite movie or documentary? PETER: No Country for Old Men — a movie about whether all events are simply random, but also a work in which no detail is left to chance. I catch something new every time I watch it. To increase technological growth/progress, what are the key things you think the government or people should do for greatest impact? PETER: Libertarians like to call out excessive regulations, and I think they’re right. But it’s a vicious circle: when governments make it harder to get things done, people come to expect less; when expectations are low, technologists are less likely to aim high with the kind of risky new ventures that could deliver major progress. The most fundamental thing we need to do is regain our sense of ambition and possibility. For those who want to improve their ability to question assumptions or commonly held “truths,” which philosophers, or reading, or exercises, or activities might you suggest? PETER: It’s a great exercise to revisit predictions about the future that were made in the past. People write a lot of history, and they make a lot of predictions, and I consume a lot of both. But it’s rare that people go and check old predictions. It’s a way to see — with the benefit of hindsight — the assumptions that people didn’t even know they were making, and that can make you more sensitive to the questionable conventions that surround us today. For example, The American Challenge by Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber argued in 1968 that Europe would be eclipsed by relentless American progress. But that progress never came. It’s instructive to go back and see why Servan-Schreiber was optimistic. Now, some questions for you all… Who should I interview next? Please let me know in the comments by clicking here .

Stephen King is definitely someone I would like to hear speaking here 0 Reply Jason palmer 11 years ago Reply to Anzhela Shurina Hire a ghost writer ? 0 Reply Renan Piccolo Colombini 11 years ago Reply to CxC I also vote for Stephen King 0 Reply Anzhela Shurina 11 years ago Reply to CxC Thank you for amazing podcast Tim! So many amazing people. Everyone knows how important it is to surround yourself with the right people to grow and discover your full potential. Sometimes you can’t physically do it but this podcast allowed me to find “my tribe” and since I started listening to the podcast I’m doing much more progress in my life. When you hear so many talented people who chose to live their lives following their path and exploring their unique talents you automatically raise your standards and star moving closer to the best YOU in your own unique way. 0 Reply Ken LaVoie 11 years ago Reply to CxC “On Writing” was awesome. I have a hard time reading mediocre authors, even if the story is great, due to being spoiled by Stephen King’s great storytelling ability and the knowledge gained from “On Writing” — However, I’d put in a second vote for Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, “The Glimmer Twins” – 50+ years as a Rock n’ Roll band? Their financial success and the size of the “machine” that is the Rolling Stones is mind boggling. Mick n’ Keith! Gotta hear em’. 0 Reply Stephan Raczak 11 years ago Brilliant as always. The calibre of guests coming on is getting better by the show. 0 Reply CxC 11 years ago I mentioned Stephen King would be a great person to interview. I think Anthony Bourdain or Alton Brown would be nice too. 0 Reply Michael Hay 11 years ago Fascinating interview as always. I would love to hear an interview with Elon Musk, Jony Ive or Stephen Fry. Keep up the great work. 0 Reply James 11 years ago I much prefer Tim leading the interview rather than this question format. I think the tangents you go down when you have a conversation with someone can uncover gems of information you wouldn’t normally get with this Q & A format. It could of been my frame of mind, or something I ate, but non of what Peter said has sunk in or stood out. Maybe it was his droning voice. Get well soon Tim and get back to the usual style of interviews! 🙂 0 Reply Mark 11 years ago Reply to James Agreed.  Seeing Peter Thiel as the interviewee in my podcast player prior to download gave me an incredible burst of excitement and anticipation for the conversation.  In listening, I have been intrigued by the Q&A, and Peter is an incredible individual who I greatly appreciate the opportunity to hear speak, but it pales in comparison to the dynamic you bring, Tim, in conversation. Thank you for bringing Peter Thiel to your podcast list…I do not mean to criticize what is legitimately a gift immortalized in podcast form…however, next time – maybe an in-between-isode or a reschedule?  Am feeling a bit like I got the hot chick at the dance but was left with major blue balls at the end of the night when she left unexpectedly… 0 Reply Mark 10 years ago Reply to Mark I was wrong. I get it now. The Q&A format has really grown on me and is an incredible supplement to the substantive brilliance of Tim interviews. Not recognizing a great idea staring me in the face during the developmental stages of the Tim Ferriss show, I was, instead, caught up with being seriously butt-hurt that I didn’t get to hear Tim question Peter Thiel after a consistent stream of Ferriss interviews. Must be some serious man-love for Ferriss! The subsequent Q&A sessions that serve as supplements to the main interviews are badass, the format is awesome! Well done…I was wrong…go on with yo bad self! 0 Reply rubthemtogether 11 years ago Another solid podcast. One I got past imagining I was listening to Peter Gregory I really enjoyed it 0 Reply Fredrik 11 years ago Tim, I’m an avid reader of your blog and your books but I honestly can’t stand listening to podcasts. From talking to a few friends I know I’m not the only one having this problem. Therefore, would you PLEASE consider providing full transcriptions of all your podcasts? That’d make your blog even more awesome. Apart from that, keep up the good work! 1 Reply coachantonia 11 years ago Reply to Fredrik Hi Fredrik, i like your idea! TIM, if you DO decide to provide transcripts, i’d be happy to do them for you. I already do them for a bunch of other world-changing people, and i’d be happy to do more! 0 Reply Ken LaVoie 11 years ago Reply to Fredrik Same here … haven’t heard a single one of them, I can’t sit still. Transcripts would be read …. podcasts never will in my home I’m afraid. 0 Reply Nik 11 years ago Interview Elon Musk next? 0 Reply xlfx 11 years ago Reply to Nik Would be so awesome! 0 Reply Timothy 11 years ago My vote: you should interview the founder of wikipedia. 0 Reply s4shivShiv 11 years ago Dear Tim, Would like you to interview Peter Diamindis in your next episode. 0 Reply Mike Woolard 11 years ago Pls interview tony heisch from zappos and élan musk .  Great job appreciate the effort . Mike 0 Reply Jamie Taylor 11 years ago Hi Tim, would it be possible to include audio only versions of the Video podacts in the RSS feed?  Also a brief description of who was on the podcast and what was discussed.  As much as I love what you do I would like to be able to choose which podcasts to listen to by what is in them rather than have to go through them all to find the stuff that most interests me. 0 Reply Alexander Dziri 11 years ago Thanks for this episode Tim! how about Gary Vaynerchuk? 0 Reply Timothy 11 years ago I have one more opinion. The most interesting people are people who created or did a thing that would not have existed at all had they not been born. Or it would have existed in some very different form and the world is better off because of it. That’s why I recommend someone like the person(s) behind wikipedia. The people who fit that description at least to some small extent are my favorite to read about. Like Gordon Hempton, who I think quit or lost his job, got inspired, then recorded the sound of birds at sunrise all over the world and then won an emmy. Then he wrote One Square Inch of Silence, a popular, informative book that made people aware that true natural silence is an endangered species. That’s the kind of person I love hearing from. Who else would’ve gotten the idea to record the sound of birdsong at sunrise all over the world and then make a best-selling book about silence in the natural world? 0 Reply Drew Jankowski 11 years ago You should do Andrew Yang from Venture For America! 0 Reply Kris S 11 years ago I think you should consider interviewing Brene Brown! She is a researcher, author and very funny!  Love all your podcasts! 0 Reply lynnyang880612 11 years ago Reply to Kris S good point I read all of her books 🙂 “Daring Greatly” helped me go through my depression 0 Reply J 11 years ago Nice, really enjoyed it. For next interview…Mantak Chia 0 Reply CL 11 years ago Next interview… How about Malcolm Gladwell to investigate his genius, research process, and how he deftly weaves entertaining narrative with academic research. 0 Reply Rick Randy 11 years ago Reply to CL hahahahahahaha 0 Reply Gluck 11 years ago Peter Thiel is awesome! I love that Ipin a world where college is almost obsolete that he picks his favs to drop out for a 100k and great startup support. We need more iniatives like that – let’s hear from Ronen Gafni in your next interview! 0 Reply Simcha Gluck 11 years ago Peter Thiel is awesome! I love that in a world where college is almost obsolete that he picks his favs to drop out for a 100k and great startup support. We need more iniatives like that – let’s hear from Ronen Gafni in your next interview! 0 Reply Gabriel Fernandez 11 years ago Very much enjoying the podcast. It is always refreshing to learn about unconventional wisdom. The opportunity to get into the mind of some of the shakers in our world is invaluable. Tim, I would DEFINITELY like to see Gary Vaynerchuk be a guest in the near future! 0 Reply sdh 11 years ago Besides probably difficult to get people like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk – for a next podcast, please consider: Tony Hsieh or Magnus Walker. 0 Reply Chris Krohn 11 years ago Brilliant perspective on re-defining success, at both the societal and personal levels, and what it will take to thrive going forward. Thank you. 0 Reply Anonymous 11 years ago I’d suggest Paul Graham, Jack Kornfield and Mark Manson. 0 Reply Luis 11 years ago Hi Tim, I would go out a bit of the “usual” circle of famous entrepreneurs, and check out other inspiring people (not “on” the radar). As a starting point: Lucho Quequezana. Check him out on google and you´ll know why :). Cheers Luis 0 Reply Adam Mirkovich 11 years ago Enjoyed it. But it was a bit short for me. Perhaps I just enjoyed Kevin Kelly epic podcast-a-thon so much, this wa"
