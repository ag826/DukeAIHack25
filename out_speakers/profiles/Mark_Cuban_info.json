He is the former principal owner and current minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and co-owner of 2929 Entertainment . From 2012 to 2025, he was also one of the main \"sharks\" on the ABC reality television series Shark Tank . [ 2 ] As of May 2025, Forbes has estimated his net worth to be US$6 billion. [ 3 ] Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania , Cuban was involved in ventures from a young age, from selling garbage bags to running newspapers during a strike. He graduated from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University and embarked on a diverse business career that included founding MicroSolutions and Broadcast.com , both of which he sold at substantial profits. Cuban's investments span various industries, from technology and media to sports and entertainment. He has been a prominent figure in the NBA, known for his active involvement with the Mavericks (with which he won the 2011 NBA Championship as owner) and disputes with the league's management. In his side ventures, Cuban has been involved in philanthropy, political commentary, and reality television. Early life and education [ edit ] Cuban was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] on July 31, 1958. [ 6 ] His father, Norton Cuban, was an automobile upholsterer . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Cuban described his mother, Shirley (née Feldman), [ 10 ] as someone with \"a different job or different career goal every other week.\" [ 11 ] Cuban is Jewish , [ 12 ] and grew up in Mt. Lebanon , an affluent suburb of Pittsburgh , in a working-class family. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] His paternal grandfather changed the surname from \"Chabenisky\" to \"Cuban\" after his family emigrated from Russian Empire (modern territory of Ukraine ) through Ellis Island . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] His maternal grandfather was a Bessarabian Jewish immigrant [ 17 ] and his maternal grandmother was from Lithuania . [ 18 ] Cuban first ventured into business at age of 12. He sold garbage bags to pay for a pair of expensive sneakers. [ 4 ] [ 19 ] A few years later, he earned money by selling stamps and coins. [ 20 ] At age 16, Cuban took advantage of a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette strike by running newspapers from Cleveland to Pittsburgh. [ 21 ] Instead of completing his senior year of high school, he enrolled as a full-time student at the University of Pittsburgh , where he became a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity . After one year at the University of Pittsburgh, Cuban transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana , where he graduated from the Kelley School of Business in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science degree in management . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] He chose Indiana's Kelley School of Business without even visiting the campus because it \"had the least expensive tuition of all the business schools on the top 10 list\". He had various business ventures during college, including a bar, disco lessons, and a chain letter . [ 4 ] [ 25 ] After graduating, Cuban returned to Pittsburgh and took a job with Mellon Bank , where he immersed himself in the study of machines and networking. [ 26 ] Business career [ edit ] On July 7, 1982, Cuban moved to Dallas , Texas, where he first found a job as a bartender for a Greenville Avenue bar called Elan [ 27 ] [ 28 ] and then as a salesperson for Your Business Software, one of the earliest PC software retailers in Dallas. [ 29 ] He was fired less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store. [ 30 ] [ 20 ] Cuban co-founded MicroSolutions with support from his previous customers at Your Business Software. Initially, MicroSolutions operated as a systems integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as Carbon Copy , Lotus Notes , and CompuServe . [ 31 ] One of the company's largest clients was Perot Systems . [ 32 ] The company grew to more than $30 million in revenue, and in 1990, Cuban sold MicroSolutions to CompuServe —then a subsidiary of H&R Block —for $6 million \n(over $14.7 million  today). [ 23 ] He made approximately $2 million after taxes on the deal. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Audionet and Broadcast.com [ edit ] In 1995, Cuban and fellow Indiana University alumnus Todd Wagner joined Audionet (founded in 1989 by Chris Jaeb, who retained 10% of the company), combining their mutual interest in Indiana Hoosier college basketball and webcasting . [ 35 ] With a single server and an ISDN line, [ 36 ] Audionet became Broadcast.com in 1998. [ 34 ] By 1999, Broadcast.com had grown to 330 employees and $13.5 million in revenue for the second quarter. [ 37 ] In 1999, Broadcast.com helped launch the first live-streamed Victoria's Secret Fashion Show . [ 38 ] That year, during the dot com boom , Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo! for $5.7 billion in Yahoo! stock. [ 39 ] Yahoo!'s costly purchase of Broadcast.com is now regarded as one of the worst internet acquisitions of all time. Broadcast.com and Yahoo!'s other broadcasting services were discontinued within a few years after the acquisition. [ 40 ] Cuban has repeatedly described himself as very lucky to have sold the company before the dot-com bubble burst. However, he also emphasized that he hedged against the Yahoo! shares he received from the sale and would have lost most of his fortune if he had not done so. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Cuban continues to work with Wagner in another venture, 2929 Entertainment , which provides vertically integrated production and distribution of films and video. [ 43 ] On September 24, 2003, the firm purchased Landmark Theatres , a chain of 58 arthouse movie theaters. [ 44 ] The company is also responsible for the updated version of the TV show Star Search , which was broadcast on CBS . [ 45 ] 2929 Entertainment released Bubble , a movie directed by Steven Soderbergh , in 2006. Investments in startups [ edit ] Cuban has also assisted ventures in the social software and distributed networking industries. He was an owner of IceRocket , a search engine that scours the blogosphere for content. [ 46 ] In 2005, Cuban invested $1.7 million in file-sharing company Red Swoosh , co-founded by Travis Kalanick , providing much-needed capital to the company after the early 2000s recession . Red Swoosh was acquired by Akamai for $19 million in 2007. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Kalanick later approached Cuban in 2009 to invest in his next venture Uber at a $10 million valuation. Cuban proposed a $5 million valuation, but never heard back from Kalanick. [ 49 ] He was also an investor in Weblogs, Inc. , which was acquired by AOL . [ 50 ] Cuban at the Web 2.0 Conference in 2005 In 2005, Cuban invested in Brondell Inc., a San Francisco startup making a high-tech toilet seat called a Swash that works like a bidet but mounts on a standard toilet. \"People tend to approach technology the same way, whether it's in front of them, or behind them\", Cuban joked. [ 51 ] He also invested in Goowy Media Inc., a San Diego Internet software startup. In April 2006, Sirius Satellite Radio announced that Cuban would host his own weekly radio talk show, Mark Cuban's Radio Maverick . [ 52 ] However, the show has not materialized. In July 2006, Cuban financed Sharesleuth.com , [ 53 ] a website created by former St. Louis Post-Dispatch investigative reporter Christopher Carey to uncover fraud and misinformation in publicly traded companies. Experimenting with a new business model for making online journalism financially viable, Cuban disclosed that he would take positions in the shares of companies mentioned in Sharesleuth.com in advance of publication. Business and legal analysts questioned the appropriateness of shorting a stock before making public pronouncements which are likely to result in losses in that stock's value. Cuban insisted that the practice is legal in view of full disclosure. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] In April 2007, Cuban partnered with Mascot Books to publish his first children's book, Let's Go, Mavs! . In November 2011, he wrote a 30,000-word e-book (60 to 120 pages), How to Win at the Sport of Business: If I Can Do It, You Can Do It , which he described as \"a way to get motivated\". [ 57 ] In October 2008, Cuban started Bailoutsleuth.com [ 58 ] as a grassroots, online portal for oversight over the U.S. government's $700 billion \"bailout\" of financial institutions. It no longer exists as a website. In September 2010, Cuban provided an undisclosed amount of venture capital to store-front analytics company Motionloft. According to the company's CEO Jon Mills, he cold-emailed Cuban on a whim with the business proposition and said Cuban quickly responded that he would like to hear more. Mills credited that sentence for launching the company. [ 59 ] In November 2013, several investors questioned Cuban about Mills' representation of a pending acquisition of Motionloft. Cuban denied an acquisition was in place. [ 60 ] Mills was terminated as CEO of Motionloft by stockholders on December 1, 2013, and in February 2014 was arrested by the FBI and charged with wire fraud; it was alleged that Mills misrepresented to investors that Motionloft was going to be acquired by Cisco . [ 61 ] Cuban has gone on record to state that the technology, which at least in part is meant to serve the commercial real estate industry, is \"game changing\" for tenants. [ 62 ] In 2019, Cuban, Ashton Kutcher , Steve Watts and Watts' wife Angela acquired a 50% stake in Veldskoen Shoes ' United States business. [ 63 ] In 2021, Cuban, Pantera Capital , BlockTower, Hashed, Cadenza Ventures (backed by 100x Group), CMS and QCP Capital backed a layer-2 decentralized exchange protocol, Injective Protocol and their CEO Eric Chen. Also in late 2021, Cuban purchased the entire town of Mustang, Texas , a 77-acre town in Navarro County . He told the Dallas Morning News that a friend needed to sell it, and \"I don't know what if anything I will do with it.\" [ 64 ] Shark Tank [ edit ] Cuban has been a \"shark\" investor on the ABC reality program Shark Tank since season two in 2011. Cuban at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2014 As of May 2015, he has invested in 85 deals across 111 Shark Tank episodes, for a total of $19.9 million. [ 65 ] In 2022, Cuban stated that his portfolio of Shark Tank investments had made a net loss, saying \"I've gotten beat\". [ 66 ] The actual numbers may vary because the investment happens after the handshake deal on live television and after due diligence is performed to ensure the accuracy of the information presented in the pitch room. [ 2 ] For instance, Hy-Conn, a manufacturer of fire hose adapters, after agreeing to a deal of $1.25 million for 100% of the company with Cuban, did not go through with the deal. [ 67 ] Cuban's top three deals, all with at least $1 million invested, are Ten Thirty One Productions , Rugged Maniac Obstacle Race, and BeatBox Beverages . [ 65 ] Since Cuban joined the show in 2011, the ratings for Shark Tank have increased , and also during his tenure, the show has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Structured Reality Program (from 2014 to 2017). Before the category came into existence it won the award for outstanding reality program for two consecutive seasons (2012 to 2013), all of these awards came after he joined. Cuban was the richest of all Sharks to appear on the show, until Michael Rubin and Todd Graves came onto the show in seasons 15 and 16 respectively. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] He announced in November 2023 that the show's 16th season would be his last. [ 70 ] Magnolia Pictures [ edit ] Cuban owns film distributor Magnolia Pictures . Through Magnolia, he financed Redacted , a fictional dramatization based on the 2006 Mahmudiyah killings , written and directed by Brian De Palma . [ 71 ] In September 2007, Cuban, in his capacity as owner of Magnolia Pictures, removed disturbing photographs from the concluding moments of the film Redacted , citing copyrights/permissions issues. [ 72 ] In April 2011, Cuban put Magnolia Pictures and Landmark Theatres up for sale, but said, \"If we don't get the price and premium we want, we are happy to continue to make money from the properties.\" [ 73 ] Cryptocurrency [ edit ] Cuban at SXSW 2025 Cuban has invested in the cryptocurrency Dogecoin , as well as accepting the particular cryptocurrency as a method of payment for Dallas Mavericks merchandise and tickets since at least early 2021. [ 74 ] After being asked by CNBC for his thoughts on the payment method, Cuban responded, \"It's a medium that can be used for the acquisition of goods and services. The community for doge is the strongest when it comes to using it as a medium of exchange.\" [ 74 ] After Voyager Digital , a cryptocurrency lender, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022, [ 75 ] Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks were named in a class-action lawsuit that alleged that Voyager Digital was a Ponzi scheme the following month due to Cuban's promotion of Voyager and Voyager's sponsorship with the team. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media . [ 78 ] In September 2023, Cuban's MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet was drained by scammers. As a result, he had lost about $870,000 worth of tokens. [ 79 ] Cost Plus Drugs [ edit ] In January 2022, Cuban launched Cost Plus Drugs , with the aim of lowering generic drug prices for end consumers in the U.S. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] Cuban started the company after receiving an email from a radiologist named Alex Oshmyansky, who pitched the idea of an online-based pharmacy. [ 83 ] He often refers to Cost Plus Drugs as a critique and disruptor of the US healthcare system, including offering transparent, direct-to-consumer pricing and reducing the role of pharmacy benefit managers . [ 84 ] Sports businesses [ edit ] Dallas Mavericks [ edit ] Cuban as owner of the Dallas Mavericks in 2008 On January 4, 2000, Cuban purchased a majority stake in the NBA 's Dallas Mavericks for $285 million from H. Ross Perot Jr. [ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] In the 20 years before Cuban bought the team,",

While this led to a cautionary wave in public markets, this scenario echoes the trajectory of cloud platforms in the early- to mid-2010s where where initial hype and trials eventually paved the way for widespread adoption over the next decade. \n\n🔹 A key insight in the MIT report was that opting to \"buy\" AI solutions often proves more fruitful than attempting to \"build\" them from scratch. DIY approaches were successful only 1/3rd of the time vs. buying off-the-shelf AI tools resulted in a success rate of 67%. Enterprises don't need to re-invent the wheel; instead leverage your key strengths and core differentiators to build on top of best-of-breed vendors.\n\n🔹 The report also highlighted the main reason why AI pilots fail - flawed enterprise integration. The \"learning gap\" for both tools and talent is real in a world where technology moves as the speed of light. The tools in itself can be great only when they are appropriately integrated into workflows and the rest of the tech stack, as well as training and re-skilling the workforce to use the tools.\n\nWe are still in very early innings of the enterprise AI shift where AI is poised to become the cornerstone of software stacks, similar to what cloud is today. Enterprise adoption takes time and often cycles through growing pains as what we're experiencing today. \n\nThe forthcoming decade promises transformative changes, paving the way for the emergence of groundbreaking enterprise AI companies that will shape the future landscape. 82 17 Comments Akash Bajwa AI startups should be optimistic about weathering the current period of macro headwinds and coming out stronger. \n\nQ1 CIO surveys and 2025 guidance paint a concerning picture as uncertainty from tariffs begins to affect software budgets, sales cycles, and pipeline conversion. \n\nIn periods like this, buyers consolidate around platforms. Just like 'AI or die' has been internalised by incumbents and startups, 'Platform or die' is more important than ever. Companies with high attach rates on multiple SKUs have much higher retention.\n\nAnother reason AI startups should be optimistic is that consumption-based pricing aligns neatly with buyer preferences to align dollars spent with value creation. \n\nAI budgets are going to be resilient through this period. The key question is, will those be captured by incumbents or startups? \n\nAdditional reads include essays from Alex Danco, Julian Lehr and more.

Greeley This Should Work…\nInvestments in healthcare technology should work. There can be a legitimate debate about the wisdom of the magnitude of overall AI investment activity, now estimated to be $320 billion just in 2025, but undoubtedly most will see significant healthcare benefits from this infrastructure buildout. But there may also be merit to the argument that certain knock-on effects of AI will undermine for some improvements in the quality of life. At a minimum, it is not entirely clear that the agentic arms race unfolding between payors and providers will entirely help patients versus improving the economics of the combatants.\nInvestor excitement in healthcare AI is reflected in digital health investment activity, notwithstanding challenges to reconcile the more modest valuation multiples for publicly traded companies with those of lofty private market multiples. According to Rock Health, year-to-date $9.9 billion has been invested in 351 companies. For 3Q25, $3.5 billion was invested in 107 companies putting the sector on pace to have ~$14 billion invested in around 450 companies, which would signify an encouraging recovery closer to 2022 levels.\nThoughts on what to expect next... https://lnkd.in/ef5s2jJF Flare Capital Partners #digitalhealth 35 3 Comments Amy Francetic The pace of capital flowing into AI feels familiar.\n\nThese two charts from Apollo Academy highlight just how quickly expectations (and valuations) have risen. History tells us that periods of exuberance are almost always followed by a correction.\n\nAt Buoyant, we believe both sides of this story can be true:\n\n✅  Yes, the current surge of investment is likely ahead of itself.\n✅ And yes, the underlying transformation is as inevitable as the Internet’s rise 25 years ago.\n\nWe’ve seen this same pattern in climate tech: early hype, painful correction, and then enduring progress as the world reorganizes around a fundamental shift. The companies that endure are the ones that solve real problems with staying power.\n\nOur responsibility as investors at Buoyant Ventures is not to chase the froth, but to stay grounded in fundamentals — backing entrepreneurs who are building durable businesses that will still matter long after the cycle cools.\n\nAI’s trajectory may be uneven, but like climate tech, its long-term impact is unstoppable. 🤛 \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gga2igQJ\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gfmRy-VG 30 3 Comments Pano Anthos Fascinating report published by MIT and reported on in Fortune. The report highlights that only 5% of AI pilot projects successfully scale, with most failures occurring in internal development rather than vendor-led initiatives. Integration emerges as the primary barrier to scaling AI projects.\n\nThe current Silicon Valley approach emphasizes sales and marketing, which benefits startups but is less impactful for large enterprises where a minimum of 1% revenue lift is required to get any C-suite attention. In these organizations, the real challenge lies in integrating AI across diverse constituencies, hierarchies, and applications. This complexity is evident in typical SAP implementations, where consulting and integration costs far exceed the application itself.\n\nI saw this first hand building Pantero -- a semantic broker. Time and time again, enterprise architects favored expediency and speed via cheap XML integration hacks using XSLT -- I know so old!! instead of building and leveraging metadata to ensure extensability and re-use, especially since systems change regularly.\n\nThe report highlights that most AI solutions today focus on sales and marketing, which is not where enterprises see the greatest impact. Instead, significant value comes from simplifying processes across multiple systems and organizational layers. This requires a strong service orientation, exemplified by companies like Palantir, which build solutions around integrated services.\n\nBut AI lacks an inherent orchestration capability. The analogy I like to draw is that the chat interface is the equivalent of the basic line prompt which so many marveled at back in the early Bill Gates days but real impact is going to r",

Today he owns a minority stake in the NBA's Dallas Mavericks and is cofounder of Cost Plus Drugs, which he launched in January 2022 with the aim of lowering prescription drug prices. Cuban sold 58% of the Dallas Mavericks in December 2023 for an estimated $2 billion (pre-tax). He sold stamps door-to-door as a kid and gave disco lessons to help pay his way through Indiana University. Cuban was inspired to strike out on his own when he was fired from a software shop for closing a $15,000 sale instead of cleaning up the store.

And they're getting hoggy. \"Just watch. Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. When you try to take it too far, people turn the other way. I'm just telling you, when you've got a good thing and you get greedy, it always, always, always, always, always turns on you. That's rule No. 1 of business.\" Cuban was specifically referring to the NFL's recently expanding its television package. He considers it a poor business decision for the NFL, which consistently dominates TV ratings, to play games on days other than Sunday and Monday. In February, the league announced a one-year deal with CBS and NFL Network to televise Thursday night games. CBS will air the games during the first eight weeks of the season, simulcasting them with NFL Network. The league's cable network will exclusively show six Thursday night games later in the season with CBS' top announcing tandem of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms in the booth. NFL Network also will have a Saturday doubleheader in Week 16. The NFL started a limited package of Thursday night games in 2006. NFL Network showed 13 Thursday night games last season. \"They're trying to take over every night of TV,\" Cuban said. \"Initially, it'll be, 'Yeah, they're the biggest-rating thing that there is.' OK, Thursday, that's great, regardless of whether it impacts [the NBA] during that period when we cross over. Then if it gets Saturday, now you're impacting colleges. Now it's on four days a week. \"It's all football. At some point, the people get sick of it.\" Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones disagreed with Cuban's take. \"We certainly do a lot of work as you know before we jump on these things,\" Jones said at the NFL owners' meeting in Orlando. \"Certainly I can see why he might not say that, that we're getting too saturated. But I think we've done a lot of work to think that we're not.\" Cuban said the NFL is making a mistake by valuing television money over the convenience of fans who are used to planning for their NFL teams to play on Sundays with occasional Monday night games. He compared it to the decline in popularity of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" after the game show expanded to air five days a week. \"They put it on every night,\" Cuban said. \"Not 100 percent analogous, but they handled it the same. I'm just telling you, pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.\" Cuban expounded on his views Monday afternoon on Twitter.
